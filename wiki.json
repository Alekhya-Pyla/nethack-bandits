    "wumpus": "Wumpus\nThe wumpus, , is a very slow but strong monster in \"NetHack\".\nThe wumpus can cling to ceilings, allowing it to be generated over and move through water without drowning or being relocated. You can ride a pet wumpus while on land, but if you try to ride over water, you will fall off the wumpus and into the water, wetting your inventory and possibly drowning. If you don't drown, you end on an attached land square, and the wumpus will be on the water square you tried to ride on; the saddle stays on the wumpus.\nIt is a rather rare creature but not among the rarest. Should you ascend a game, you are pretty much guaranteed to meet at least a few wumpuses.\nWumpuses generated as part of a level usually start off asleep (80% chance), though this does not apply to any wumpuses generated after level creation, or any wumpus generated after you have picked up the Amulet of Yendor.\nThe Ranger quest locate level has a guaranteed wumpus.\nThis monster is a reference to the early text adventure game ; the Ranger quest locate level is an homage to the game.\n",
    "archeologist": "Archeologist\nArcheologists are one of the harder roles, but can become powerful in the late game. They are often called Arcs for short and start the game with speed and stealth. According to the guidebook:\nThe Archeologist role, especially its starting equipment, is influenced by 1954's where Harry Steele (Charlton Heston) is a dashing explorer of ancient ruins with leather jacket and fedora. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) was inspired by Secret of the Incas and added\u2014in 1981\u2014the army bag (sack) and bullwhip that this role carries to the iconic archeologist image. \nArcheologists can be lawful (human or dwarf) or neutral (human or gnome).\nBULLET::::- +2 bullwhip,\nBULLET::::- +0 leather jacket,\nBULLET::::- +0 fedora,\nBULLET::::- 3 to 6 uncursed food rations,\nBULLET::::- +0 pick-axe,\nBULLET::::- uncursed tinning kit (30 to 99 charges),\nBULLET::::- uncursed touchstone,\nBULLET::::- uncursed sack.\nBULLET::::- Following chances of one of:,\nBULLET::::- 10% uncursed tin opener,\nBULLET::::- 22.5% uncursed oil lamp,\nBULLET::::- 6.75% uncursed magic marker (30 to 99 charges).\nArcheologists gain the following abilities upon reaching the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1: Stealth\nBULLET::::- XL 1: Speed\nBULLET::::- XL 10: Searching\nArcheologists start with \"Basic\" skill in the categories \"Whip\" and \"Pick-axe\".\nArcheologists can use uncursed touchstones as if they were blessed, formally identifying the type of any gem.\nArcheologists suffer a -1 alignment penalty for breaking a historic statue.\nLawful archeologists suffer a -3 alignment penalty for digging up a headstone. However, \"chaotic\" archeologists get a +3 alignment bonus.\nThe early game must be played cautiously, like the Tourist and Healer. Archeologist is considered one of the most difficult roles, if not outright the most difficult. Its starting resources don't contribute as much to survival as many other roles, so the Archaeologist is more reliant on items they find.\nYour starting touchstone can make the first few floors of the mines very profitable. Your starting pick-axe can also be used to dig out gold, gems, and vaults in the early levels, and dig down through floors. Thus, you can accumulate a lot of wealth in just the first few floors of the dungeon and mines. This makes buying protection from Minetown doable, even if you gain a few levels on the way. If you do make it to Minetown at level 1, you should be able to buy protection several times.\nThe advantages of the Mines mean that it should be pursued before Sokoban. Continuing to Mines' End is very risky; although the luckstone and random tools can be useful to you, monster generation is difficult enough that you're not likely to survive as you are. Make sure to complete it eventually, though.\nSokoban can be a good choice afterward, because you can use your starting pickaxe to break boulders if need be, and your sack can store the food and items that are plentiful there. It's also good for exercising your low starting strength.\nLuck is very important early in the game, so save at least one cheap gem to throw to a co-aligned unicorn. Because throwing an identified precious gem gives a +5 boost to Luck, consider doing it even before you find a luckstone.\nSince you start with intrinsic speed, invisibility is a highly desirable quality for avoiding monsters. A fast, invisible, opponent is hard to chase down. Stealth is also helpful for clearing out treasure zoos and throne rooms, as it leaves enemies sleeping.\nThe best early weapon is the pick-axe. In general, you want to seek out a dwarvish mattock (look for dwarves mining around in the Gnomish Mines), because they use pick-axe skill and do more damage than any other non-artifact weapon. Thus, it's best to use the pickaxe and enhance it when available, preparing for using a dwarvish mattock. However, if you start out with physical stats that assign penalties (i.e. 9 or lower Strength or Dexterity) you may need to use the whip at first for its +2 bonus. \nThe whip is decent at first because of the +2 bonus, but after a few levels it becomes less effective, and it doesn't train pick-axe skill. Don't forget that you can apply it towards a monster even while not wielding it, which will disarm the monster if your dexterity is 6 or higher. This can be a lifesaver when fighting some monsters, given your poor starting AC. It can also be a good way to deprive a dwarf of its mattock. \nArcheologists suffer from a lack of good ranged weapon options. Boomerangs do 1d9 damage and can be advanced to expert, but they are quite rare and their flight pattern is unusual. Slings can be advanced to skilled, but they are weak and rocks are very heavy. However, with your starting touchstone you will identify numerous pieces of worthless glass which do the same damage as a rock but at 1/10 the weight. Darts and daggers are your other two plentiful options in the early game, both of which can be advanced to basic. Daggers are good because they will never break, but a large stack of darts with +2 or better enchantment is also worthwhile. \nStarting in 3.6.1, the aklys is a ranged weapon and Archaeologists can achieve skilled with clubs, the category of the aklys. Many of the gnomes in the mines are likely to be generated with aklys, identified initially as thonged clubs. The aklys will return to hand 99% of the time like Mjollnir when thrown, so it makes a particularly effective early ranged weapon. It does 1d6/1d3 damage which beats darts and daggers, since Archaeologists can't multishot. Watch out for rusting as they are made of iron.\nArcheologists should have poison resistance before doing the quest, because the quest is full of poisonous snakes. Familiarize yourself with safe-to-eat monsters that give poison resistance, since Archeologists tend to have low constitution and HP. Your starting tinning kit is very helpful, allowing you to safely eat poisonous corpses for the chance of intrinsics.\nThe quest contains one guaranteed coaligned altar; this may be a good place to wait and sacrifice monsters if you haven't found an artifact weapon yet.\nYou should not rely on The Orb of Detection as a source of magic resistance; the Wizard of Yendor can easily steal it. Unless you wish for another quest artifact or use Magicbane, that essentially requires you to wear either gray dragon scale mail or a cloak of magic resistance.\nBecause you start with low physical stats and melee penalties, acquiring an artifact weapon is a central concern. It's not a bad idea to camp on an altar you find and sacrifice for a gift. Archeologists have good artifact weapon possibilities, such as Grayswandir, Mjollnir, Vorpal Blade, and Magicbane. Lawful players can also dip for Excalibur if they find a long sword (though it will not be unrestricted unless you have had another long sword gifted to you).\nDwarvish mattocks and silver sabers are good non-artifact weapons, and one or the other should be trained to Expert. If you are planning to get Grayswandir or at least two-weapon with a silver saber, you should begin training saber skill as soon as you find one. The watch captain in Minetown often carries one, so consider getting a pet to kill him for it. If you disarm him with your whip, it will anger him but not the other guards.\nAs you progress through the game and level up, spellcasting becomes more of an option. Your high starting intelligence makes you good at reading spellbooks without needing to bless them. You can become proficient in several spell schools, meaning that you can become competent at casting many low-level spells. However, armor usually remains more important than spells through the early and mid game. Don't ditch good metal armor in favor of spellcasting until you're confident you can survive without it.\nFor Archeologists, the best strategy is to find a good artifact weapon, enchant it up, and stick with it through the rest of the game. Two-weaponing is reliable because your experience level and Luck at this point completely cancel out the the -7 to-hit penalty.\nThe best artifact weapon for you is Grayswandir, which does double damage and silver damage. It is one of the few artifact weapons you can advance to Expert. The neutral artifact weapons for Archeologists are quite good as well, but Grayswandir is so excellent that you might want to consider wishing for it even if you're neutral.\nIn the mid-game and beyond, you may want to advance divination spells to Skilled for casting magic mapping, which is your special spell and can be greatly useful in Gehennom. and are also nice to have, and identify is always useful. Don't advance them to Expert unless you really need your failure rates to be lower.\nSince most of your useful spells are utility spells, it isn't necessary to avoid metal armor\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1-2: Digger\nBULLET::::- XL 3-5: Field Worker\nBULLET::::- XL 6-9: Investigator\nBULLET::::- XL 10-13: Exhumer\nBULLET::::- XL 14-17: Excavator\nBULLET::::- XL 18-21: Spelunker\nBULLET::::- XL 22-25: Speleologist\nBULLET::::- XL 26-29: Collector\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Curator\nThe archeologist quest artifact is The Orb of Detection, a crystal ball. When carried, it confers magic resistance, telepathy and half damage when attacked by spells. When #invoked, it toggles invisibility on/off.\nIn SLASH'EM, Archeologists may be doppelgangers, elves, or hobbits in addition to the vanilla roles. They can use the research technique at level 1. The starting equipment has also changed.\nThey begin with a spellbook, one of , , , , or , 2 random scrolls, a 25% chance of a blindfold, a 25% chance of a towel if they did not get a blindfold, 25% chance of a leash, a 25% chance of a tin opener or a 25% chance of either an oil lamp or a torch if they did not get the tin opener, and a 12.5% chance of a magic marker. The starting fedora has also changed in SLASH'EM and gives +1 charisma and acts as a luckstone when worn.\nUnNetHack replaces the Orb of Detection with the Itlachiayaque, an artifact shield of reflection, that confers ESP, half spell damage and fire resistance. When invoked, it produces player targettable stinking cloud. The starting fedora can be safely enchanted past +5 up to +7, and grants +2 luck when worn, but it does not function as a luckstone.\n",
    "medusa": "Medusa\nMedusa is a dangerous monster with her own level, which is somewhere in the main Dungeons of Doom, but below the level that contains the magic portal to the Quest. Beware\u2014as in Greek mythology, her gaze can turn people to stone. Additionally, eating the corpse of Medusa is a similarly bad idea that will also turn you to stone.\nMedusa will never be left in a bones file. However, her statue will; this is bug C342-54. As this will not prevent generation of an ordinary Medusa in the game loading the bones until the statue is unstoned, this can be used to have two or more Medusas in a single game.\nAny corpses of unique monsters (including Medusa) can be left in bones files, allowing you to use undead turning to get multiple unique monsters.\nThe difficult thing about reaching Medusa is crossing the water full of sea monsters. Levitation or water walking boots are the most common ways to cross the water. Using a wand of cold, a frost horn or the cone of cold spell to freeze a path across the water is another option, as is filling the water with boulders, or some means of jumping.\nIf you are trying to reach the island with boulders, you can push them to the stairs of the previous level and throw items to make them roll down. Alternatively, you can read preferably uncursed scrolls of earth if not enough boulders are available. 8 boulders are needed for the first version and 16 for the second; this can be reduced to 7 and 14 respectively if you are willing to jump into water and crawl out.\nAn amulet of magical breathing may also be used to traverse the level underwater, with attendant effects.\nIf crossing the water is not an option, you may also opt to dig a hole to the next level and then come back up by using the staircase. The stairs to the next level are in the same room as Medusa, so make sure that you are ready for her before going up the stairs!\nThe best way to avoid turning to stone is to have reflection; she will look at you, see her reflection, and turn to stone. (This makes her different from the Greek myth, or else Perseus could not have looked in his mirror to ) This can also be achieved by applying a mirror on her. Otherwise, you may blind yourself, or polymorph into a stoning-resistant creature, or you may rely on the speed system to kill her in one turn, e.g. with a spell or wand of death. Don't rely on the sleep spell to neutralize her gaze. As of NetHack 3.6.0, hallucination will protect against all gaze attacks 75% of the time, but this shouldn't be relied upon.\nIf you cancel Medusa, you render her gaze ineffective, and get YAFM: \"Medusa doesn't look all that ugly.\"\nYou lose pacifist conduct if you reflect Medusa's gaze to kill her. Becoming invisible will protect her from her own (reflected) gaze. Pacifists may find it useful either to simply blind her and let pets deal with her \"peacefully\", or to blind yourself and give Medusa some powerful attack wands so she can kill herself with her own rebound. \nSometimes Medusa can escape to the upstairs, and/or up to the previous level. She can also escape downstairs. So if you lost track of her (i.e. entered blind and then she disappeared from the telepathy map but you don't see a corpse), beware of her around her lair and on the levels immediately above and below.\nIf you don't have reflection, you might like to investigate the statue of Perseus after killing Medusa.\nMedusa first appears in NetHack 2.2a.\nHer lair first appears in NetHack 3.1.0. Before that version, she appeared in an ordinary room-type level. It seems likely that many an adventurer met an untimely end from not knowing he would soon see Medusa. NetHack 3.0.0 adds a number of statues to her room, but this is an ambiguous clue. The use of telepathy or a potion of monster detection is advisable.\nNethack 3.6.0 added two new possible layouts for Medusa's Island.\nIn UnNetHack, hallucination protects you from the stoning gaze.\n",
    "killer bee": "Killer bee\nThe killer bee, , is a monster that appears in NetHack. They are capable of flight and can outrun an unburdened character with fast speed. While not especially strong individually, they are quite fast and their sting is poisoned, which can drain strength and even instantly kill you if you are not resistant. Their corpses are poisonous and may also drain strength on top of damaging you, but have a 30% chance of granting poison resistance.\nAll killer bees are female, oviparous and inediate.\nAs indicated by the encyclopedia entry, killer bees are most likely to be generated in large groups. Kicking a tree may also summon one or more killer bees. \nSpecial rooms known as beehives may appear in the dungeon, as hinted at by the encyclopedia entry, and contains a horde of killer bees, a queen bee, and lumps of royal jelly.\nDespite their offensive threat, killer bees have low HP, and will often die in a couple of hits; however, they have a low natural AC, making them hard to hit in the first place. Discretion is the better part of valor; if you are low-level, burdened, and/or lack poison resistance, you will want to get away as quickly as possible, using a suitable wand or escape item. Elbereth can also offer some breathing room if you find it difficult to avoid them.\nIf you plan to actually fight back, then drawing them into narrow corridors is a valuable tactic, either to handle them one at a time or else decimate them with wands or spells; killer bees have no monster magic resistance, and even a wand of striking or magic missile will suffice. An effective alternative, especially for pacifists, is to lead the bees to a falling rock trap, which will dispose of them quickly. A source of extrinsic poison resistance, such as an alchemy smock or amulet versus poison, will prevent the worst of the damage from the stings; high magic cancellation from armor can offer some protection as a last resort.\nAs killer bee corpses are poisonous and also confer intrinsic poison resistance, extrinsic resistance will also prevent strength loss and significantly reduce damage from the poison until you finally obtain the intrinsic, which should not take too long. You can also nullify the strength penalty through the use of a ring of sustain ability, or reverse it with a unicorn horn; you may also want a tinning kit, which removes the poison and slightly increases the nutrition provided per corpse.\nBULLET::::- Beehive\nBULLET::::- Queen bee\nBULLET::::- Lump of royal jelly\n",
    "keystone kop": "Keystone Kop\nThe Keystone Kop monster class comprises human law enforcers that are summoned whenever you steal from a shop, such as by teleporting out of the shop or digging downwards. Outside of those situations, the only time the Keystone Kops are otherwise seen is during the Tourist quest, where several of them occupy the police station on the last floor.\nKeystone Kops attack you by throwing cream pies and using the clubs and rubber hoses they bring with them. While they are each not very difficult to eliminate on their own, their numbers are quite intimidating. Fortunately, Kops generated in response to theft will vanish as soon as you pay or pacify the shopkeeper, together with anything they pick up. Watch your missile weapons.\nThere are four kinds of Kops: s, s, s and s. Keystone Kops will not become extinct after 120 of each kind have been created, though they are genocidable.\nAlthough their symbol is , they are considered human for all other purposes, including sacrificing. They do, however, respect Elbereth, but only when occupied by the player.\nThe Kops are a very good source of experience and cream pies.\nOne minor strategy with shopkeepers is to steal a gold piece from the shop and leave for a distant corner of the dungeon; this will summon a slew of Kops and their equipment, followed by the shopkeeper. After slaughtering the Kops, pay or pacify the shopkeeper. Note that Kops that evaporate in this way don't leave death drops. Warning! If you angered him by something else than stealing, it will take at least 1000 gold to pacify him; make sure you have that much cash.\nAnother option, if you are strong enough to deal with a mass of Kops but do not want to face an angry shopkeeper, is to push a boulder onto the doorway of the shop before you steal.\nNetHack's Kops got their name from the , an incompetent bunch of policemen featured in a series of films from 1912 to 1917.\nIn UnNetHack, when a Kop is killed, there is a 1/5 chance that another is summoned near the stairs and a 1/5 chance that one appears on a random part of the level. In addition, the Kops can no longer be genocided.\nIn Slash'EM Extended, shoplifting will generate higher-level Kops with a higher chance, and the player character's level is no longer taken into account. In addition to swarms of Kops, the shopkeeper will also summon soldiers and hostile watchmen from thin air. On rare occasions, an arch-lich is summoned as well, making shoplifting much more dangerous for low-level characters.\nAdditionally, like in UnNetHack, killing a Kop will sometimes make it reappear on the current dungeon level, or sometimes it will cause the spawn of any random K-class monster instead. Kops do not disappear after pacifying the shopkeeper. Also, killing a shopkeeper or vault guard will surround the player character with a bunch of random K, regardless of who actually killed the NPC.\n",

    "death": "Riders\nThree of the \u2014Death, Famine, and Pestilence (all )\u2014appear in \"NetHack\" as monsters on the Astral Plane. They are collectively known as the Riders, even though they are not riding anything. However, the name \"Riders\" has existed since before riding was implemented.\nThe Riders are some of the most physically damaging enemies in the game, in addition to the special effects each Rider possesses, so beware facing them in melee with poor AC. However, all of them have very low HP (at most 80), and so are quite easy to kill. \nNone of the Riders respect Elbereth, and they also ignore the sanctuary effect given to you by a coaligned priest in its temple.\nAll three Riders can fly, are humanoid, can regenerate themselves, can see invisible creatures, have teleport control, and have a low natural armor class.\nThe Riders cannot be stoned and have all elemental resistances and full monster MR. The Riders are not disintegration-resistant, per se, in the way that black dragons are; however, attempting to disintegrate one of them will cause it to re-integrate instantly. \nRiders come back to life after being killed: after 12 turns, a Rider corpse has a chance of revival on each turn. Eating a Rider's corpse kills you instantly; if you survive with an amulet of life saving, the corpse revives immediately anyway (and your wisdom is abused for good measure). Their corpses cannot be polymorphed, and they will instantly revive if you try to pick them up, tin them, push a boulder on their square, teleport them, etc. If a digesting monster such as a purple worm tries to eat a Rider, the engulfer dies and the Rider is unharmed.\nTeleportation has a special effect on Riders: if they are zapped with a wand of teleportation, they are teleported to a square adjacent to you with probability . This is a very Bad Idea. Attempting to teleport or tin their corpses is also a bad idea, as they will be immediately revived.\nEach Rider can make two special touch attacks per turn. These are some of the deadliest attacks in \"NetHack\". If they would hit you with both attacks in the same turn, the game takes pity on you and converts the second attack into a stunning touch; this has lead to misconceptions that the Riders' main attacks specifically cause stunning. The stun effect also prevents you from fighting back effectively, so you'll probably have to use a unicorn horn to clear the status effect and hope you don't get hit with it again on the Rider's next attack.\nDeath has a melee attack that reduces your maximum HP, and uses the touch of death. Zapping a wand of death or casting the spell at it heals it.\nSince NetHack 3.6.0, as a tribute to Terry Pratchett, Death speaks in ALL CAPS and without quotation marks, like it does in the \"Discworld\" series of novels. Additionally, you will get a YAFM if you chat to it while carrying a Terry Pratchett novel.\nFamine has a hunger-inducing melee attack. You will lose 40\u201380 nutrition points per hit, unless you have fainted.\nPestilence has a disease-spreading melee attack. Potions of sickness heal Pestilence (and it is generated with\u00a0a small supply you might want to dispose of after killing it the first time); potions of would damage it, but the effects will always be completely resisted unless it is severely level-drained first. Spells of will also damage it and will do 3d4 or 3d8 damage, halved due to the guaranteed resistance.\n\"You\" are War.\nIn the game, only Death, Famine, and Pestilence are named. If you #chat to one of them, they ask, \"Who do you think you are, War?\" though the wording makes the meaning ambiguous. However, a comment in the source code is definitely not ambiguous:\nFurthermore, attempting to tin the corpse of a Rider gives the message, \"Yes... But War does not preserve its enemies...\"\nIn 3.6.1, it is possible for T-shirts to generate with the message \"Hello, I'm War!\"\nThe Riders resist elemental attacks, but have a low HP, which allows you to kill them with ordinary physical attacks. Famine and Pestilence are both vulnerable to death rays (Death absorbs them and increases its maximum HP), and all three Riders are vulnerable to magic missiles.\nOf the three riders, Pestilence is widely considered to be the most dangerous. Therefore, players often use telepathy to identify which altar is guarded by Pestilence, and then explore the other altars first in hopes of avoiding an encounter with Pestilence.\nThrown potions of (extra/full) healing damage Pestilence and reduce its maximum hit points. Thrown or quaffed potions of sickness heal it. Pestilence may spawn carrying potions of sickness; the first time you kill it, you should pick these up and dispose of them.\nAcid blobs are a good candidate for filling up the Astral Plane to dismiss the Riders, as they can be created \"en masse\" with scrolls of create monster while confused. As a fallback method if you lack enough scrolls, reading the cursed Book of the Dead will create lots of graveyard monsters and only partially respect extinction, but some of those monsters can be quite dangerous. As of NetHack 3.6.3, the Riders cannot swap positions with a monster located in a square that is ineligible for corpse creation.\nAlthough the normal way to get the Riders off your back is simply to ascend, there are a few trickier ways.\nBULLET::::- The primary way to permanently banish them is to kill them, then fill every square on the level with monsters so that when they revive, there is nowhere for them to go. When you see the message \"You feel much less hassled,\" a Rider corpse has started to decay, and will eventually rot away, provided that you do nothing to disturb it.\nBULLET::::- When the level is filled with monsters, you can eat a Rider corpse without it reviving, provided you are wearing an amulet of life saving. (If your meal is interrupted, you will need another amulet.) This provides teleport control, which is useless on the Astral Plane.\nBULLET::::- Attempting to pick up or tin a Rider corpse will still fail when there is nowhere for it to revive.\nBULLET::::- A hostile gelatinous cube can \"eat\" their corpse but not digest it, placing it into the cube's inventory. You could then steal it as a nymph. To destroy it, you can repeatedly loot a cursed bag of holding in 0 turns, or a number of other methods. The Rider corpses will give you severe encumbrance problems; if you are completely unable to lift 1450 units, the corpse will drop uselessly to the floor.\nBULLET::::- Riders have full magic resistance, which makes them immune to polymorph, but if you polymorph yourself into a green slime, you can turn them to slime because your sliming attack is not considered magical. If you want, you can then tame the resulting green slimes. Similarly, a substantial herd of tamed green slimes stands some chance of turning a Rider into a slime, although this is only somewhat less risky.\nBULLET::::- Famine and Pestilence can be tamed with charm monster if they are level-drained first (though they will resist the spell ). Death is immune to level drain.\nThe horsemen are characters in \"Revelation\", the last book of the Bible.\nThe remaining horseman (described as the first in Revelation) does not seem to actually correspond to any kind of plague. The idea of Pestilence as a horseman is probably derived from passages following the description of Death, but is not actually a part of the Biblical prophecies. \nSo opens \"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\" by Vicente Blasco Ibanez, as translated from Spanish to English by Charlotte Brewster Jordan. The book is in the public domain; you can read it at Google Books. Since the mention of the four horsemen in the Bible, they have appeared in many other places: in the book quoted above, in the books' various motion film versions, and also in roguelike games including \"ToME\" and \"NetHack\".\nGreyKnight has written a rudimentary patch which occasionally replaces the Riders with some or all of the .

    "famine": "Riders\nThree of the \u2014Death, Famine, and Pestilence (all )\u2014appear in \"NetHack\" as monsters on the Astral Plane. They are collectively known as the Riders, even though they are not riding anything. However, the name \"Riders\" has existed since before riding was implemented.\nThe Riders are some of the most physically damaging enemies in the game, in addition to the special effects each Rider possesses, so beware facing them in melee with poor AC. However, all of them have very low HP (at most 80), and so are quite easy to kill. \nNone of the Riders respect Elbereth, and they also ignore the sanctuary effect given to you by a coaligned priest in its temple.\nAll three Riders can fly, are humanoid, can regenerate themselves, can see invisible creatures, have teleport control, and have a low natural armor class.\nThe Riders cannot be stoned and have all elemental resistances and full monster MR. The Riders are not disintegration-resistant, per se, in the way that black dragons are; however, attempting to disintegrate one of them will cause it to re-integrate instantly. \nRiders come back to life after being killed: after 12 turns, a Rider corpse has a chance of revival on each turn. Eating a Rider's corpse kills you instantly; if you survive with an amulet of life saving, the corpse revives immediately anyway (and your wisdom is abused for good measure). Their corpses cannot be polymorphed, and they will instantly revive if you try to pick them up, tin them, push a boulder on their square, teleport them, etc. If a digesting monster such as a purple worm tries to eat a Rider, the engulfer dies and the Rider is unharmed.\nTeleportation has a special effect on Riders: if they are zapped with a wand of teleportation, they are teleported to a square adjacent to you with probability .

    "xorn": "Xorn\nA xorn is a monster notable for its ability to walk through walls (often referred to as \"phasing\") and eat metal. Xorns are also fire, cold, and stoning resistant and unbreathing.\nThe xorn is the only member of the xorn monster class.\nXorns are rarely randomly generated and typically will not be encountered until the Castle. Xorns can be generated on the Plane of Earth by digging with a pick-axe.\nIn version 3.4.3, xorns could be created in inaccessible areas, such as outside the Sokoban walls. This was bug C343-151.\nAlso in 3.4.3, when a player polymorphed into a xorn returned to their normal form and was in open space, they would be stuck in a pit that doesn't exist; this was bug C343-17.\nDue to their unusual abilities, xorns are one of the most useful monsters to polymorph into. Some applications:\nBULLET::::- Eating jewelry for intrinsics\nBULLET::::- Phasing across difficult-to-navigate levels such as Asmodeus' Lair or the Stronghold of the Master Assassin (note that you cannot phase across the boundary between the two parts of Moloch's Sanctum, or anywhere on the Astral Plane)\nBULLET::::- Going directly to the wand of wishing in the Castle during a speedrun or with a weak character\nWarning: When morphing into a xorn any worn armor or cloaks will likely be destroyed, so remove these items before making the transformation. \nIf you return to normal form while phasing through a wall that's adjacent to open space, you will be able to move into the open space. However, if you return to normal form while phasing through the middle of solid stone with no adjacent space, you will be unable to move; you can teleport out, pray (being stuck in a wall while non-phasing is a major problem), or polymorph yourself into a xorn (or earth elemental) again.\nXorns have a moderately powerful attack that can be dangerous to weaker characters, especially because it is very difficult to prevent them from ganging up on you. However, they respect Elbereth and have speed 9 so are usually easy to outrun if necessary.\nXorns are considered kebabable (able to be skewered), and you receive a +2 to-hit bonus when using a weapon that uses the spear or javelin skills. Xorns are also susceptible to digging attacks, and again you receive a +2 to-hit bonus when using pick-axes or dwarvish mattocks. These bonuses are very rarely useful, as by the time you are fighting xorns you do not normally have trouble hitting things, and +2 is not a large bonus anyway.\nMonster xorns cannot cross the water in the castle level (although polymorphed heroes can). It is often enough to lure them across the drawbridge and raise it behind you. Xorns cannot be destroyed by the drawbridge under normal circumstances (they'll just phase through it), but if there are two phasing monsters on the drawbridge, one on the portcullis square and one on the moat square, one of them will be killed if the drawbridge is raised.\nThe original xorn comes from the game Dungeons & Dragons. In that game the xorn eats stone in addition to metals, which might explain the message present in the code for eating flint stones.\n",

    "zruty": "Zruty\nZruties are the only member of the zruty monster class.\nZruties get two hit attacks and a bite attack. They have no other special abilities.\nThe origin of the zruty in \"NetHack\" is uncertain.\nA book called \"The Mythology of All Races\" lists the zruty with this quote: \"The Slovaks have their Zruty, or Ozruti, who are wild and gigantic beings, living in the wildernesses of the Tatra Mountains.\" The similar phrasing suggests that this book is the origin of the monster and of the in-game Encyclopaedia entry. The lie on the border between Poland and Slovakia, so the origins of the zruty could indeed be in Polish or Slovakian mythology.\nThe word \"zrut\" (or, more correctly, \"\u017er\u00fat\", pronounced //) means someone or something that eats fast and much. The plural form is \"\u017er\u00fati\" or \"\u017er\u00faty\".\nThe word \"ozruta\" would be probably best translated as 'giant' (although a Slovak-English dictionary suggests also 'ogre' or 'whopper'). Today it is used to describe anything too big (often something that is bigger than needed, but also large mountains can be called ozruty).\nIn variants that include zouthern animals, zruties are moved to the monster class as .\nIn xNetHack, zruties are removed outright, with the glyph occupied by sea monsters.\n",
    "newt": "Newt\nA newt is one of the lower-level NetHack monsters, usually appearing on the first few floors. It can be quite the nuisance for low level characters.\nEating a newt corpse occasionally raises your current Power, with the message \"You feel a mild buzz\". If your current Power is less than or equal to 2/3 of your maximum, you will always receive the increase; otherwise the chance of receiving it is 1 in 3.\nIf you do get an increase, your current Power will be increased by between 1 to 3 points. If this increase would raise you above your total maximum Power, the maximum is increased by 1, and current Power is set to maximum. \nNewts are featured prominently in Dudley's dungeon, often as creatures which kill Dudley. Strips featuring newts killing Dudley are rated poorly and are called \"newt jokes\". A reference to this phenomenon can be seen on the high score list of NAO: Adeon holds fourth rank, but has been killed by a newt.\nA newt is a species of salamander. The increase of power when eaten is probably a reference to the Shakespeare quote of the encyclopedia entry\u2014\"eye of newt\" is named as a spell component in the incantation by the witches in \"Macbeth\". This is thought to be a cryptic name for the mustard seed rather than a reference to the literal eye of a literal newt.\n",
    "water demon": "Water demon\nA water demon is a type of demon that appears in the game, and one of the less powerful ones.\nLike most major demons, water demons may summon other demons when they attack. At least of the summons will be other water demons. All chaotic demons are also eligible, but those whose difficulty is greater than the current dungeon level are exponentially unlikely. In practice, that mixes a few foocubi into the summons. There is a chance, however, that they may summon Juiblex or Yeenoghu.\nA player may not polymorph into a water demon.\nIn the early stages of the game, a common way to summon a water demon is by quaffing or dipping from a fountain. These demons may either be hostile or friendly; a friendly demon grants a wish. A demon will be hostile with probability (80 + LD)%, where LD is your current level difficulty; thus, if you have the Amulet of Yendor, a demon will always be hostile. Although water demons are relatively weak for demons, they are likely to wipe out most early-game characters. Players who cannot kill them quickly will probably find themselves fighting two or more.\nIn the early game, don't quaff from fountains and try to keep use of fountains (dipping) to a minimum. Later on, when you're capable of easily taking on water demons and water mocassins and are carrying several escape items, you can dip items repeatedly in all the fountains from DLvl 1 to 19 for the wish, including in the mines. (This is somewhat safer than quaffing). The chances are very roughly that you'll get a wish from some water demon.\n",
    "watchman": "Watchman\nThe watchman and watch captain are monsters that appear in \"NetHack\", and are most commonly seen as the peace-keeping Minetown watch. If you #chat with a peaceful watchman, they will complain about their jobs.\nWatchmen and watch captains are always generated peaceful; they are considered mercenaries, and as such follow the special rules for generation detailed in that article.\nSeveral watchmen and at least one watch captain will be generated in any version of Minetown, with the exception of Orcish Town, where only their corpses will be found; the Bustling Town variant will generate two watch captains. Two watchmen will also be generated in the anterooms of the Archaeologist quest home level. A watchman can grow up into a watch captain.\nWhile watchmen are always generated peaceful, they can become hostile through a number of player actions. All watchmen and watch captains on the current level will become hostile and try to kill you if you perform any of the following actions: \nBULLET::::- Directly attacking a peaceful watchman, unless the attack kills them in a single hit.\nBULLET::::- Directly attacking a peaceful shopkeeper or stealing from shops.\nBULLET::::- Attacking any peaceful monster in sight of the watchman.\nBULLET::::- Attacking the priest.\nBULLET::::- Cutting down or kicking trees.\nBULLET::::- Destroying or drying up fountains.\nBULLET::::- Digging through walls and razing doors with a wand or spell of digging.\nBULLET::::- Kicking down doors.\nBULLET::::- Improvising with a bugle; as watchmen are mercenaries, this will anger them and any other soldiers present on the level.\nThe following actions will be interrupted if a watchman sees you, and will result in a warning (with some exceptions), followed by them turning hostile if you continue:\nBULLET::::- Digging through walls or doors with a pickaxe.\nBULLET::::- Dipping into or quaffing from a fountain; this is also signaled by the fountain's flow \"reducing to a trickle\", even if a watchman is not in sight.\nBULLET::::- However, if you dip for Excalibur and successfully receive it, the fountain will dry up without warning, and the watch will become hostile whether or not they are in sight.\nBULLET::::- Spending multiple turns locking or unlocking doors; however, the watch will not object if the action takes one turn, which is more likely to happen with a skeleton key for non-Rogues. Getting warned will also cause the door to become trapped.\nBULLET::::- This is because NetHack stores the data \"the player has been warned about this door\" and \"this door is booby trapped\" in the same piece of memory; the developers made some notes in the code regarding the problem.\nBULLET::::- Note that attempting to unlock the door again \"immediately\" after will cause them to turn hostile, and unlocking a trapped door will give no warning. However, attempting to #untrap the door instead will not turn the watch hostile even if your attempt sets it off and destroys the door; the watchmen will only check for immediate attempts to pick the lock.\nBreaking doors, chopping down trees, and digging through non-shop walls will not anger a watchman if they do not directly witness the act; drying up fountains and attacking priests and shopkeepers will still anger the watch, regardless of whether they are in sight.\nIf you don't want to commit murder but the watchmen are getting in your way, there are several ways to get rid of them:\nBULLET::::- Buy a key from a Minetown shop (if you don't already have one) and use it to lock the watchmen inside some of the empty rooms. They won't see you locking it from inside the door, so as long as there are no other watchmen in sight, this is fairly safe.\nBULLET::::- Lure the watchmen to other levels by having them follow you to an up or down stair. If they are adjacent to you when you use the stairs, they will follow you to the next level, at which point you can lose them in the new level and return to Minetown alone.\nBULLET::::- Get a pet to kill them. A large cat or dog can kill watchmen fairly easily. Watch captains can be more dangerous, but if you have a healing spell or are confident the pet has high hitpoints, it can probably take out the captain too.\nIf you anger a watchman, you can use a scroll of taming or spell of charm monster, which will pacify watchmen reliably due to their low monster magic resistance (especially if multiple watchmen are after you). However, if this happens as a low-level character, you are probably best off running and coming back later once you can fight them or have a means of pacifying them. As mercenaries, bribing watchmen is possible, but not recommended due to the amount of gold required for it to be reliable in any way; throwing gold at an already peaceful watchman will anger them.\nIf you can manage it, stealing any (preferably inexpensive) item from a shop and then pacifying the shopkeeper will also pacify any watchmen, regardless of your original offense.\nWatchmen and watch captains move at the same speed and share similar movement patterns; watch captains have a higher base level, hit roughly three times as hard, and are likely to have much better AC, armor and weapons than a standard watchman. The watchmen are relatively easy to kill unless you are low-level, and their inventory, while unimpressive, is likely to have some good filler items, such as gloves. The watch captains are much harder to kill, but have a 50% chance of carrying a silver saber. Avoid doing anything that will anger all the watchmen to avoid being surrounded. As previously mentioned, if playing a low-level character, the best to do is to run away from Minetown and come back later.\nPets will often go after the watchmen upon gaining enough levels, and can be used to dispatch them without risking any penalties; however, the watch captain is likely to take out even a high-leveled domestic pet unless they are healed regularly or else polymorphed into a better form (e.g. any dragon). A leash and/or magic whistle is recommended if you wish to stop your lower-leveled pet from constantly attacking watchmen and risking their life.\nKilling watchmen to sacrifice them is not recommended, even if you are a chaotic non-human, as angering and killing them gives you a huge alignment hit, independent of any penalties for murder. Early in the game, when you typically reach Minetown, your alignment record cap is low; even without murder penalties, your alignment will take enough of a hit that recovery can be long and tedious at absolute best. If you are intent on doing so, it is wise to sacrifice at the altar until you are sure your alignment is positive, and confirm it through means such as a stethoscope.\n",
    "watch captain": "Watchman\nThe watchman and watch captain are monsters that appear in \"NetHack\", and are most commonly seen as the peace-keeping Minetown watch. If you #chat with a peaceful watchman, they will complain about their jobs.\nWatchmen and watch captains are always generated peaceful; they are considered mercenaries, and as such follow the special rules for generation detailed in that article.\nSeveral watchmen and at least one watch captain will be generated in any version of Minetown, with the exception of Orcish Town, where only their corpses will be found; the Bustling Town variant will generate two watch captains.

    "shopkeeper": "Shopkeeper\nShopkeepers tend shops. They are relatively tough for low-level characters and therefore excel at preventing shoplifting.\nShopkeepers are generated with (30\u00a0\u00d7 1d100\u00a0+ 1000) zorkmids, a skeleton key, and some or all of a wand of striking, a potion of healing, a potion of extra healing, and a wand of magic missile (a d4 is rolled and that many items are generated, starting from the beginning of that list). Jewelers (shopkeepers of ring stores) also get a touchstone.\nShould a character die in the hands of a shopkeeper, or be killed while there's an angry shopkeeper around, any possible bones files will be generated with the player's grave empty\u2014the possessions are all transported to the store and inherited by the shopkeeper, who must be pacified to safely search the loot.\nFor chaotic human players, shopkeepers have a strategic value in that they are one of the few sources of human corpses in the early levels, which can be used by chaotic humans to automatically convert an altar.\nIt is usually best to avoid angering shopkeepers, but there are some ways to kill them easily, even when you have only a low-level character. By killing shopkeepers early in the game, you're able to get a lot of money.\nIf you have a cloak of magic resistance (by playing a Wizard, for instance) or an amulet of reflection, and you can become invisible inside the shop, the shopkeeper will not leave their position in front of the door while they can't see you. Now you're able to attack the shopkeeper easily with your choice of ranged attacks. Be aware that you might run out of projectiles or charges doing this, and if you are using spells, make sure to have sufficient food, particularly if you are low-level or using .\nIf you lack invisibility, you can also dig pits all around the shopkeeper. Shopkeepers won't move into pits, so you are then free to attack them at range. This requires a container to smuggle a pick-axe inside the shop, or bouncing a spell off a wall from outside the shop, since the shopkeeper will try to keep out of direct zapping range. (As an aside, shops sometimes do sell pick-axes and dwarvish mattocks. They are handled just like every other item, except that you cannot carry one into the shop outside a bag, you get a message when un-bagging it, and the shopkeeper will catch any ones you throw in.)\nAlso, using a scroll of stinking cloud can be very effective, if you can have the cloud cover most or all of the store, and close the door to prevent retaliation. However, cursed scrolls may not do enough damage to kill the shopkeeper. Again, the shopkeeper will stand still as long as they can't see you. The shopkeeper may be able to cure blindness with a potion of healing.\nAn easy way to kill shopkeepers is to zap them with a wand of polymorph. Often they will polymorph into a weak creature that is unable to zap wands against you. However, they can also polymorph into something that is much, much tougher than a shopkeeper, so keep that in mind. Due to their intrinsic MR, they will resist roughly 50% of the time. Also, a shopkeeper will never respect Elbereth, even while polymorphed into something that normally would. Should you kill a polymorphed shopkeeper, no insult to your deity will occur; thus it is the preferred method for lawful characters.\nShopkeepers are quite vulnerable to death rays, although the rays can still occasionally miss. If you find a wand in a shop with a base price of 500 zorkmids, it is either a wand of death or a wand of wishing. A wand of wishing can be used to wish for a wand of death, so either provides a means to kill the shopkeeper. (Of course, you should always wish for scrolls of charging first if needed, or a magic marker if you have identified the scroll, regardless of whether you need a wand of death.)\nThe shopkeeper will greet you and has a high tendency to chat with you.\n\"\" is either \"Hello\" or \"Greetings\". Knights are greeted instead with \"Salutations\", Samurai with \"Irasshaimase\", Tourists with \"Aloha\", and Valkyries with \"Velkommen\".\nFor unprepared characters, it is often best to appease an angry shopkeeper than try to fight. The following messages can give a clue as to the problem:\nMessages will appear if you die or #quit while you are inside a shop, or while you are on the same level as an angry shopkeeper.\nA shopkeeper \"wakes up\" if they were paralyzed or sleeping. They \"come\" if they were more than two squares away from you.\nIf you have telepathy, you can tell what type of items a shop sells by the name of its keeper. The names of hardware store shopkeepers are anagrams of the names of the developers. If a shopkeeper name derives from a developer who only worked on certain platforms, that name will only appear on those platforms. Some names available only on exotic platforms are excluded from the tools shopkeeper list below. The light shop in Minetown is always run by Izchak. Lucrezia and Dirk are catch-all names that don't imply any specific shop type.\n! Shop type\n! Possible shopkeeper names\nIn SLASH'EM, shopkeepers also provide very useful services, although they come at a hefty cost. These are identify, uncurse, appraise, weapon-works, armor-works, and charge. Additionally, they have been made far more formidable adversaries. Their base level has been raised to 24, their AC lowered to \u22126, and they are always generated with a shotgun, shells, a wand of teleportation, and a knife. This makes it quite difficult to make pets attack them; in particular, no domestic animal can be easily raised to a high enough level.\nSLASH'EM adds light and pet stores with the following potential shopkeeper names: Zarnesti, Slanic, Nehoiasu, Ludus, Sighisoara, Nisipitu, Razboieni, Bicaz, Dorohoi, Vaslui, Fetesti, Tirgu Neamt, Babadag, Zimnicea, Zlatna, Jiu, Eforie, Mamaia, Silistra, Tulovo, Panagyuritshte, Smolyan, Kirklareli, Pernik, Lom, Haskovo, Dobrinishte, Varvara, Oryahovo, Troyan, Lovech, Sliven.\n",
    "white unicorn": "Unicorn\nA unicorn is a type of monster that appears somewhat early in the dungeon. Unicorns are extremely fast (even to a player with intrinsic speed), and move in order to stay a knight's move or more away, so as to be out of range of both melee and ranged attacks. If the unicorn is pinned down in a corner, it may teleport away before the player can approach.\nThere are three types of unicorns: white, gray, and black, which correspond to lawful, neutral, and chaotic alignments respectively. The unicorn of your alignment will be peaceful; all others will be hostile. Unicorns in bones files or created by polymorph traps may be exceptions to this rule, but killing a unicorn of your own alignment always carries a \u22125 Luck penalty. (As is usual in NetHack, this penalty will not apply if you encourage your pet to kill it.)\nUnicorns do surprising amounts of damage, getting in multiple kicks and butts per turn. However, because they will not intentionally move into melee range, it is usually not difficult to avoid combat with them. This avoidance of melee doesn\u2019t seem to be true if you have a unicorn as a pet; it will attack monsters just like a cat or a dog would.\nIn the beginning of the game, when you typically are weak and need the horn, the most sound strategy for fighting unicorn is to let a pet take it out. Attacking with projectiles and rays which bounce from walls is also a good way to hit a unicorn which stays out of the direct line of sight. You can also use either a pit or a beartrap so you can attack it from a distance. It will fall in only once. If neither option is available try having it follow you down a long hall while you fire at it from a safe distance. A boomerang can be handy in this situation as well. If you are skilled or better in polearms or lance, you will be able to use one to attack the unicorn after it moves a knight's move away from you; since the unicorn favours such a position, you won't invite counterattacks. Some other tactics are to wear a cloak of displacement and try to move to a throwing position. If the unicorn attacks your displaced image, you may have a chance to attack with ranged weapons. Also, if you are very fast, you will have occasional chances to attack with ranged weapons. Especially later in the game, if you are strong enough in melee combat, you may be able to simply defeat it in direct combat.\nUnicorns cannot see invisible; once you obtain invisibility, you will have a much easier time lining them up for attacks or gems. However, note that invisibility can backfire for a weak character. If a hostile unicorn can't see you, it will not know to stay a knight's move away. Its high speed makes it likely to randomly wander adjacent to your position, at which point it will notice you and attack.\nWhen killed, a unicorn is guaranteed to leave a unicorn horn with its corpse, unless it has been revived or is a polymorphed monster from a polymorph trap, in which case it has only a 50% chance of leaving one. Eating a unicorn corpse is safe and has a chance of giving poison resistance.\nApplying a unicorn horn has a chance of curing blindness, hallucination, confusion, and stunning status effects, making a unicorn horn an essential item for all adventurers. A unicorn can also use its own horn to cure itself of these effects, producing the message \"The tip of the color unicorn's horn glows!\"\nFinally, unicorn horns are considered magical tools, making good fodder to polypile to try for a magic marker.\nA player polymorphed into a unicorn can use the #monster extended command to use their horn, which will cure ailments just as applying a noncursed horn does.\nSacrificing a unicorn at an altar is a special case and is covered in the page on sacrifices. Simply put, to receive alignment and Luck benefits, you should sacrifice on your own altar a unicorn of a different alignment. If the corpse, the altar, and you are three different alignments, it is just a regular sacrifice. Otherwise, bad things can happen.\nCoaligned unicorns are great for improving your Luck and sorting out worthless glass.\nThrowing any gem to any hostile unicorn will make it peaceful. A tame one will catch and immediately drop the gem, without any effect on Luck or identification. If the gem is worthless glass, a rock, or a gray stone, it will not affect your Luck, and the unicorn will either \"graciously\" accept it or be \"not interested in your junk\". If it is valuable, a co-aligned unicorn \"gratefully\" keeps the gem and improves your Luck. The change of Luck depends on the identification status of the gem: +5 points if the gem is formally identified, +2 points if type-named, and +1 point if completely unknown. The game does not check what the gem is named, or what its type is called, as long as one of them is defined. Therefore, you should type-name all gems before throwing them at coaligned unicorns.\nA cross-aligned unicorn will \"hesitatingly\" accept a valuable gem, and your Luck may increase or decrease by one point if the gem is not formally identified and by up to three points if it is. Because your Luck might go down, it is not generally a good idea to throw gems at these unicorns unless you're pretty sure they're glass.\nIt is easiest to fling gems at a unicorn in a non-teleport zone. Sokoban is a good such place, as unicorns are commonly seen there and they can't teleport away.\nIf you are sure you will not need the unicorn again, you might want to encourage a pet to kill it. This way, you can recover your gems without any Luck penalty.\nUnicorns also pick up any gems and stones they come across, worthless or not.\nIn lore, the unicorn is an almost unattainable target, nearly impossible to catch. Its horn is commonly depicted as being sought after for its various magical properties.\n",

Therefore, you should type-name all gems before throwing them at coaligned unicorns.\nA cross-aligned unicorn will \"hesitatingly\" accept a valuable gem, and your Luck may increase or decrease by one point if the gem is not formally identified and by up to three points if it is. Because your Luck might go down, it is not generally a good idea to throw gems at these unicorns unless you're pretty sure they're glass.\nIt is easiest to fling gems at a unicorn in a non-teleport zone. Sokoban is a good such place, as unicorns are commonly seen there and they can't teleport away.\nIf you are sure you will not need the unicorn again, you might want to encourage a pet to kill it. This way, you can recover your gems without any Luck penalty.\nUnicorns also pick up any gems and stones they come across, worthless or not.\nIn lore, the unicorn is an almost unattainable target, nearly impossible to catch. Its horn is commonly depicted as being sought after for its various magical properties.\n",
    "valkyrie": "Valkyrie\nThe Valkyrie is one of the roles in NetHack. They are based on the valkyries of Norse legend who would carry the spirits of fallen warriors to the afterlife.\nUnlike other roles, all Valkyries are required to be female when starting the game, though they can become male through polymorph or with an amulet of change. Valkyries are often considered to be the easiest role for a new player. The guidebook describes them like this:\nValkyries can be neutral or lawful humans or lawful dwarves. Their first sacrifice gift is Mjollnir. Lawful dwarf is usually the best alignment and race for a Valkyrie: they have better physical stats such as HP, the Gnomish Mines will have more peaceful monsters in comparison to a lawful human Valkyrie, and since the class has the third-highest spellcasting penalty, the mental disadvantages of dwarves rarely come into play.\nEach Valkyrie starts with the following:\nBULLET::::- a +1 long sword\nBULLET::::- a +0 dagger\nBULLET::::- a +3 small shield\nBULLET::::- 1\u20132 food rations\nBULLET::::- an oil lamp (16.7% chance)\nValkyries gain intrinsics at these experience levels:\nBULLET::::- Level 1: cold resistance\nBULLET::::- Level 1: stealth\nBULLET::::- Level 7: speed\nValkyries start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Long sword\" and \"Dagger\".\nValkyries use wisdom as their spellcasting stat.\nThe Valkyrie quest sees you fighting Lord Surtur for the Orb of Fate.\nBULLET::::- Lawful: Tyr\nBULLET::::- Neutral: Odin\nBULLET::::- Chaotic: Loki\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1\u20132: Stripling\nBULLET::::- XL 3\u20135: Skirmisher\nBULLET::::- XL 6\u20139: Fighter\nBULLET::::- XL 10\u201313: (Wo)man-at-arms\nBULLET::::- XL 14\u201317: Warrior\nBULLET::::- XL 18\u201321: Swashbuckler\nBULLET::::- XL 22\u201325: Hero(ine)\nBULLET::::- XL 26\u201329: Champion\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Lady/Lord\nValkyries start with a fairly good +1 long sword; for lawfuls, they can upgrade to Excalibur by #dipping it in a fountain as soon as they experience level 5. However, it is advisable to wait until at least level 7, as the intrinsic speed is a useful aid in evading and wearing down whatever monsters the fountains may spawn. Ranged weapons are not strictly necessary, but they can come in handy for wearing down particularly strong monsters, eliminating ones with annoying passive attacks, or shooting past boulders in Sokoban. The best option is usually a stack of daggers, as Valkyries can train the skill to Expert and the dungeon is a plentiful source of daggers.\nMjollnir is an incredibly powerful artifact for a guaranteed first sacrifice gift, and remains useful as a long-term option well into the late game; neutral Valkyries will almost certainly want to go for it, while lawful Valkyries will eventually have other options such as Excalibur and Grayswandir to weigh the choice against. Valkyries are the only class who can use the gauntlets of power to throw Mjollnir that can also have it return; the hammer has a 99% chance of returning, as well as a 99% chance of the player catching it unless they are impaired in some way, e.g. confused, stunned, etc.\nThe starting +3 shield is an extremely good option and incredibly light for its AC, and is thus worth keeping and fireproofing if possible. Valkyries can wear all armor without any penalty beyond weight, as the class already comes with a substantial spellcasting handicap; players should put on any armor they find that isn't cursed and burdensome, pet testing them where applicable, and upgrade to better and lighter armor as they find it. An AC of roughly \u22125 by the end of the Gnomish Mines is a reasonable goal to shoot for.\nValkyries are strong early game characters that can hold their own in one-on-one combat, but will still need to exercise caution against YASD and mind their HP, even after finding some decent armor and weapons. Poison resistance should be obtained as soon as possible, and retreating and Elbereth usage can save a Valkyrie's life many times over, especially against groups of monsters such as soldier ants and Mordor orcs.\nThe Gnomish Mines are a plentiful source of armor and weapons, and for lawful human and dwarven Valkyries it is a relatively safe first destination - many of the inhabitants will be peaceful, meaning that random monsters will be generated as hostiles instead. This in turn makes it more likely that the random items lying around the Mines may be left untouched. Lawful Valkyries can let their pet fight the inhabitants to get at their armor and weapons, though they must take care not to let them die in the process. Conversely, while neutral Valkyries will find some of the dwarves and gnomes less peaceful and more willing to pick up and use items against them, the risk also provides an opportunity to gain valuable experience and skill training while allowing them to gather weapons and armor more easily.\nAs the Orb of Fate, the Valkyrie quest artifact, acts as a luckstone, Mines' End is not strictly necessary, but can be a viable choice for players who have picked up poison resistance and want an earlier guaranteed source of luck. However, this must be weighed against the dangers of polymorph traps and other severe pitfalls en route; do not expect to find much useful loot from any of the possible Mines' End levels, apart from gems.\nBy this point, players should ideally have the scroll of enchant weapon and/or scroll of enchant armor identified, and bless a few in order to enhance the weapons and armor that will make up their future ascension kit, especially their primary artifact weapon. In addition to Excalibur and/or Mjollnir, a particularly patient Valkyrie player may want to shoot for Grayswandir or Frost Brand. Twoweaponing is a viable option to consider at around XL 10; since Valkyries can only train #twoweapon to Skilled, players taking that path should give some thought to leaving long swords at Skilled, as well as training up the skill of the desired secondary weapon if applicable. Common choices include long swords, katanas, and silver sabers.\nFire resistance is an invaluable intrinsic when preparing for the Valkyrie quest, due to the abundance of fire-based hazards and enemies; the monster generation is heavily biased towards fire ants, whose corpses can also be used as a source of the intrinsic. Fire giants can also provide the intrinsic as well as valuable strength boosts, and are plentiful on the home level as well. While neither are strictly necessary, magic resistance can also prove potentially vital if a hostile titan spawns, as well as having a source of reflection to deal with attack wands. An AC of about \u221210 with a solid weapon and fireproofed pieces of armor is considered safe, and dragon scale mail should be pursued if a wish for one has yet to be obtained. A fireproofed source of levitation or water walking boots is also handy; on the home level, even a well-prepared Valkyrie can possibly drown if the ice is melted out from under them by a fire trap.\nLord Surtur is not particularly difficult by quest nemesis standards, to the point an accidental spill into the lava or a potential mishap involving the drawbridges may prove a bigger threat. Even so, he still hits quite hard and has the standard suite of quest nemesis tactics, so you may want to use the Valkyrie's stealth to clear out the fire giants, or else intentionally awaken him to lure him away from them before engaging him. Lord Surtur himself respects Elbereth, is affected by the scroll of scare monster as of 3.6.0, and has a weakness to cold-based attacks such as the cone of cold spell. Once the Orb of Fate is secured, players can continue on to Medusa's Island and beyond.\nValkyries who make it to the Castle can typically clear it out and get the wand of wishing without too much difficulty. If a player should manage to make it to the castle without a source of reflection, Perseus's statue on Medusa's level can potentially contain a shield of reflection. Investing some of your gold in obtaining clairvoyance from an aligned priest prior to entering Gehennom can make it much easier to map the area. Magic resistance is also a must-have due to the liches and golden nagas that will most likely be generated; the scroll of scare monster is also a life-saver in case a lich decides to summon nasties.\nFor the endgame, while The Orb of Fate can work to detect portals on the Elemental Planes in a pinch, confused scrolls of gold detection are vastly preferable, as they don't immobilize you and are therefore much less dangerous.\nExcalibur remains a great weapon through the remainder of the game, especially when twoweaponed with a silver saber in the offhand; keep in mind that you cannot bribe Asmodeus and Baalzebub if you are carrying Excalibur in open inventory. While Grayswandir and/or Frost Brand are also especially good for Gehennom, any artifact long sword that isn't a hassle to use should suffice.\nMjollnir can make a good backup weapon, particularly if you have gauntlets of power, as it excels in frying some particularly nasty monsters such as mind flayers; however, many of the most dangerous endgame monsters (e.g. priests) are shock resistant. If you want to throw Mjollnir occasionally, you should keep most of your wands in your bag of holding to minimize the chance of blowing your valuable wands up\nWith half physical damage from the Orb of Fate, an armor class of \u221225 or so should be more than enough. Your magic marker charges are probably better spent on enchanting weapons or writing scrolls of magic mapping. Speed or jumping boots are very nice, but are generally not worth a wish unless you have the rest of your armor and ascension kit covered; you have the Castle armory, Orcus-town, and the rest of Gehennom to find at least one of them. If you lack GDSM and/or a magic resistance-providing artifact, you should wish for a cloak of magic resistance, since Gehennom without MR is an extremely bad idea.\nIn Fourk, Valkyries begin the game with intrinsic flying and a wand of cold, wielding a spear or war hammer instead of a longsword. Valkyries who start with a war hammer also start with speed boots, a popular ascension-kit item. In addition, Mjollnir will never harm the player nor their inventory items, and will never land at an enemy's feet. It can land at your own feet, so don't throw it while flying over lava.\nIn SLASH'EM, Valkyries start with a spear or dwarvish spear instead of a long sword.\nValkyries in SporkHack are substantially similar to Valkyries in vanilla NetHack, but there are a few wrinkles players should be aware of.\nBULLET::::- SporkHack Valkyries can be of any race. Elven and orcish Valkyries are always neutral.\nBULLET::::- It is no longer possible to obtain Excalibur by dipping; this option is only available to Lawful Knights. Therefore, unless you find lawful Knight bones (unlikely) or get crowned (more likely), you won't be getting Excalibur.\nBULLET::::- Sacrificing is no longer guaranteed to yield artifacts; it may yield mundane weapons and armor instead. These will be highly enchanted, so it is a very valuable source of early game equipment. However, it's no longer nearly as easy to obtain Mjollnir. Combined with the lack of Excalibur, this can mean that sacrificing in hopes of getting Fire or Frost Brand, Vorpal Blade, Snickersnee, or Grayswandir (depending on your alignment) is worthwhile.\nBULLET::::- With the two-weapon fighting changes in SporkHack, offhand long swords and sabers are no longer viable. Instead, consider a silver spear or silver short sword as an offhand weapon. Silver daggers, though weak, are useful as well, since Valkyries can reach expert in daggers, but are limited to Skilled in spears and short swords.\nBULLET::::- Racial armor bonuses make dwarven Valkyries even stronger than they might otherwise be\u2014but be aware that dwarves aren't the only ones who get racial armor bonuses. In particular, if you're an orc, a simple orcish helm improves AC by 3, even before enchantment.\n",
    "rogue": "Rogue\nThe Rogue is a player role. Rogues are skilled thieves. From the guidebook:\nRogues can be humans or orcs, and are always chaotic. Orcs have a slightly easier early game because of their starting food, poison resistance, infravision, and ability to commit cannibalism or same-race sacrifice with impunity. On the other hand, humans have better health and starting weapons, as well as several advantages that become important later in the game: they have slightly better hit point and energy growth than orcs, and their higher intelligence, wisdom, and charisma caps make spellcasting and consorting with foocubi more reliable.\nOrcish monsters are more likely to be generated peaceful for orcish heroes, while elven monsters (which can be a nuisance because they appear fairly early, in groups, and ignore Elbereth) are likely to be generated peaceful for chaotic humans, but will always be hostile to orcs. Human monsters are not available as early for same-race sacrifices, and some of their corpses are harder to procure reliably compared to the groups of hostile orcs that may be generated.\nBULLET::::- an uncursed +0 short sword (orcish short sword if an orc)\nBULLET::::- 6\u201316 uncursed +0 daggers (orcish daggers if an orc)\nBULLET::::- an uncursed +1 leather armor (5% chance of being blessed)\nBULLET::::- an uncursed potion of sickness\nBULLET::::- an uncursed lock pick\nBULLET::::- an uncursed sack\nBULLET::::- 20% chance of a blindfold\nBULLET::::- for orcs, 2 random food items (each of which has the usual chance of being a stack of 2)\nBULLET::::- XL 1: Stealth\nBULLET::::- XL 10: Searching\nRogues start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Short sword\" and \"Dagger\".\nRogues get a +1 bonus to multishot when throwing daggers.\nRogues can gain an additional 1d(XL) \"backstab\" damage when striking a fleeing monster and not two-weaponing. Elbereth, scrolls of scare monster, leather drums and tooled horns are particularly useful for rogues.\nThe two top priorities in the early game are finding food and developing your primary attacks, which are weighted differently for humans and orcs. Orcish rogues' starting food items buy them some time to train before they need to start looking for food; once they do need to scavenge for food, they have more options thanks to their poison resistance\u2014which allows them to eat the corpses of poisonous monsters like kobolds safely\u2014and their ability to eat their own kind without an alignment penalty. Human rogues, however, will need to look for nonpoisonous corpses and (better yet) permafood on the first few levels of the dungeons.\nSince rogues start with a relatively low strength, it is a good idea to make an early run for Sokoban and push boulders to exercise that attribute. Raising strength not only increases your carrying capacity, but also the damage potential from your thrown daggers due to the bonus it provides; the random food items generated in that branch are also very welcome to a hungry rogue, and both of the two possible prizes can be of great use to them. A bag of holding helps shore up the low carrying capacity of a low-strength Rogue, while an amulet of reflection can protect your inventory and save you from many potentially game-ending wand attack that you may encounter.\nA rogue's best attack in the early game is a volley of thrown daggers. Rogues should rely on throwing daggers as much as circumstances and their stock of daggers permit, to raise the dagger skill to Expert before anything else. Having Expert level in the skill, combined with the role's bonus to multishot, allows you to throw up to four daggers at once, and gives each dagger a +2 damage bonus. However, be aware that if one of your daggers kills your target, any remaining daggers you threw may fly past the corpse and anger peaceful monsters behind it. Use the numeric prefix to fire only one dagger at a time when necessary, especially in Minetown.\nYou may choose to wield one of your daggers in melee as well, instead of your starting short sword, because every bit of dagger training helps. There is little reason to train your short sword skill anyway, since you won't be using it once you get an artifact melee weapon; however, an elven short sword is perfectly serviceable for later twoweaponing. One dagger can be separated from your starting stack for wielding by using the #adjust command with a number prefix to change the letter under which it is stored in your inventory; as of the NetHack 3.6.0 series, it is possible to quiver all but one of a wielded stack of weapons, changing the letter of the second set automatically. You can then #name the two sets differently to prevent them stacking.\nTo increase your supply of ammunition, collect any daggers you find, but curse-test them before wielding any. Elven daggers are especially desirable\u2014being made of wood, they cannot rust or corrode, so they are good for fighting rust monsters and acidic monsters that would damage iron weapons.\nMissiles other than daggers\u2014such as darts, arrows, crossbow bolts, and shuriken\u2014can be poisoned by #dipping them into your starting potion of sickness. One strategy is to #untrap dart traps, which are fairly common in the upper levels of the Dungeons of Doom, and then poison the resulting large stack of darts using the potion. Poisoned weapons do an additional d6 damage to non-resistant monsters, and also have a 10% chance of killing the monster outright, making it ideal for tougher monsters; be aware, however, that intelligent monsters can pick up poisoned weapons and toss them back at you! Magic cancellation does not protect against poisoning from thrown weapons, so obtain poison resistance as soon as possible if you do not have it yet, and use poisoned missiles cautiously until then; orcs start with poison resistance, making this a much less risky option for them.\nRogues can also reach Expert in crossbows, so another possibility is to collect bolts in the Mines and poison them. Unlike darts, bolts require a launcher, but their damage potential is greater (1d4+1/1d6+1 vs 1d3/1d2). Both kinds of missiles have a chance of breaking, which can be reduced by enchanting them; if you plan to use crossbows, do not advance their skill beyond Basic until you have mastered daggers.\nRogues are one of the few roles who can reach Expert in twoweapon combat. They also reach Expert in the knife skill, so they are the role that gets the most effect out of using a crysknife as a secondary weapon.\nHowever, twoweaponing was relatively unpopular with those playing 3.4.3 rogues because (1) rogues cannot reach Expert skill in the better artifact weapons (besides Magicbane, which is cross-aligned) and (2) rogues cannot backstab if they are wielding two weapons at once, sacrificing the bonus damage that was one of the most popular features of the role. Because of this, many players did not train the twoweapon skill at all, reserving the skill points for other skills, and using the free hand to augment their AC with a shield. As of NetHack 3.6.0, backstab damage has been significantly weakened: it now only occurs in single weapon melee and no longer applies to thrown projectiles. So, while useful as an early game tactic, backstab's intermittent damage bonus now pales in comparison to consistent, high-level twoweaponing in the later game.\nTwoweaponing can be considered an alternative way to produce major artifact damage with weaker weapons. Ignoring all strength, enchantment and skill bonuses, a single Grayswandir will average 9 and 19.5 damage against non-haters and silver-haters respectively. A crysknife/silver dagger twoweapon will yield approximately 7.75 and 18.25. But with full strength, skill and enchantment available to a rogue, a single-handed Grayswandir will average 30 and 40.5 while the the crysknife/silver dagger twoweapon averages 35.75 and 46.25; the chaotic Grimtooth averages the same damage as a single crysknife for a Rogue without requiring training in a new skill.\nA Rogue's starting leather armor is not very good past the early game, and can be traded out for almost any noncursed body armor. Given their restrictions on attack and healing spells, rogues are not likely to rely heavily on magic in the heat of battle for most of the game, so they should not be as concerned about spellcasting failure. They typically start with low strength, however, and encumberment is a serious inconvenience in the early game, so avoid wearing anything you cannot lift without becoming Burdened. Mithril coats are most ideal for the early game, as they are not only high AC (and MC2) but weigh no more than your starting leather armor. Once you are confident in your fighting skills, fight dwarves and hobbits to relieve them of their mail.\nRogues who seek to backstab over twoweaponing in 3.4.3, previous versions and variants based on them lose the least from wearing a shield, since all of their best weapons are one-handed; the shield of reflection is their best option, eliminating the need for an amulet of reflection or SDSM and freeing up the neck and torso slots for other items, but they are unfortunately rare. This is much less true as of 3.6.0 and later versions, where twoweaponing is more preferable.\nRogues are at a disadvantage when it comes to attempting the protection racket, because while their starting sack is handy for shoplifting and credit cloning, the Mines will inevitably be dangerous because dwarves and gnomes alike are hostile to chaotics. Since armor is less disadvantageous for Rogues than for other roles, racking up early protection points is less urgent for them.\nRogues do not start with knowledge of any spells or skill in any spell school, and their starting intelligence (their spellcasting attribute) and spellcasting power are both low, so spellcasting is not likely to be reliable in the early game. \nHowever, once you have a reliable source of food, and a safe place to read, it may be worthwhile to pick up spellbooks and read them so you can recognize useful spellbooks later. Spells in the divination, escape, and matter classes can be trained, while most spells outside of your strong schools can be forgotten and cast to confuse yourself later.\nOnce you have learned low-level spells in your schools (such as detect monsters and jumping) and have at least 5 power points, you can take advantages of lulls in the action to remove interfering armor and practice casting those spells to train the respective skills after you have reached expert in daggers.\nThe Rogue quest is infamous as one of the trickiest in NetHack, but the problem is not so much with the nemesis (the Master Assassin is not especially dangerous to a Rogue who has reached the quest branch) as with getting past the various obstacles to reaching him. A successful Rogue will consider the quest's challenges in advance and prepare a means of overcoming each one before embarking on the quest.\nThe major challenges:\nBULLET::::- The home level contains several chameleons. The longer you spend on this level, the greater the chance that one will turn into a master- or arch-lich, warp to you, and cast a spell that ruins your day.\nBULLET::::- About of generated monsters will be nymphs, with the corresponding hazards of losing your weapon and armor and having your wands used against you. Guardian nagas are also quite common, so have either MC3 or a ring of free action to prevent paralysis.\nBULLET::::- There are three distinct sections of the goal level: one containing the up stairs, one containing the Nemesis, and one containing neither. Because the three segments are partitioned by non-diggable walls and the level is no-teleport, gaining access to the Master Assassin is non-trivial.\nIf you don't have magic resistance, try to kill the liches fast, and be ready to engrave Elbereth if one does show up. If you have a ring of protection from shape changers, keep it on until you have hunted down all eight chameleons.\nUse your daggers or darts to eliminate the nymphs from a distance, and try to avoid getting surrounded on the locate level. If you have polymorph control, polymorphing into a nymph or succubus will protect you from their theft attacks. \nOn the goal level, there are a number of ways of reaching the Master Assassin:\nBULLET::::- Digging down from the previous level and hopefully landing in the region where the quest nemesis is, waking him, and then getting out of the level by quaffing a cursed potion of gain level or by reading a cursed scroll of teleportation or reading an uncursed scroll of teleportation while confused. Once the Master Assassin is awake, he will warp to the up stairs, and you can meet him there by descending the stairs normally. Be prepared to do this multiple times if you land in the section without the Nemesis.\nBULLET::::- Polymorph yourself into a xorn to be able to walk through walls (be sure to remove your cloak and body armor first to avoid destroying them).\nBULLET::::- Apply a drum of earthquake; this may wake up the Master Assassin.\nBULLET::::- Use the psychic blast of a tame mind flayer (or polyself) to alert the Master Assassin of your presence.\nBULLET::::- Quaff a cursed potion of invisibility while standing on the stairs to awaken the Master Assassin who will then teleport to you.\nThe Rogue quest artifact is the Master Key of Thievery, a very nice artifact which confers the half physical damage, warning, and teleport control extrinsics. It can also be invoked to untrap boxes and doors with 100% success, though this is somewhat useless unless you know the door or chest is trapped, something most players don't bother to check.\nWarning is superseded by telepathy, and there are other sources of teleport control, but half physical damage is useful enough that the Master Key a wish target for other roles. It does not grant magic resistance, however, so you should be on the lookout for other sources of this extrinsic (such as a cloak of magic resistance, Magicbane, or certain other quest artifacts).\nOnce you have a large supply of daggers, you can start using scrolls of enchant weapon to raise their enchantment, which increases not only their damage potential but their accuracy. If you find a ring of increase damage with a positive enchantment, wear it when throwing daggers, as the damage bonus applies to each dagger that hits, so the effect is multiplied. Scrolls of charging can be used to raise the ring's enchantment.\nIn the midgame, rogues can look for a powerful artifact weapon so they can back up their ranged daggerstorm with a strong melee attack that uses their backstab bonus to full effect. Sacrificing for an artifact weapon is not terribly useful for rogues, since they do not have a guaranteed sacrifice gift in vanilla and they will have to accept one of the chaotic sacrifice gifts\u2014which, with the exception of Stormbringer, are either very weak or of very narrow utility\u2014before they have any hope of getting one of the more useful (and unaligned) Brands.\nTwo better options are Magicbane and Grayswandir. Magicbane's scare attack frequently causes monsters to flee, and more importantly, it is an athame, so you can reliably engrave Elbereth. Grayswandir is another worthwhile weapon to consider; rogues can reach Skilled in saber, and Grayswandir's double damage applies to backstab damage. Both weapons are cross-aligned for chaotic rogues, so you will never receive them as sacrifice gifts; you will either have to use an early wish, or find one in a bones pile (be sure to curse-test before wielding). Watch out for the (admittedly small) blasting damage.\nRogues can reach Skilled in divination spells and escape spells, as well as the somewhat less useful matter spells, and human rogues can reach a respectable 87% success rate without a robe. You most likely started the game with a mediocre intelligence, so consider collecting any potions you find and performing alchemy to brew up some potions of gain ability. In the absence of useful spells, rogues are better off ignoring spellcasting entirely, though.\nDivination spells are worth raising to Skilled once you have at least two skill slots free, since several spells in this class (detect monsters, detect treasure, and identify) have improved effects at this level. Identify can save you a lot of curse-testing, and magic mapping is a boon in Gehennom. Advancing escape spells to Skilled is less important, but can be useful if you want to rely on the jumping spell to reach tiles not accessible with jumping boots, or be able to terminate the levitation spell at will.\nThere is little reason to advance matter spells far, however, because rogues are unlikely to have the spellcasting abilities or power to cast polymorph.\nIf you chose to use a shield instead of twoweaponing, and you haven't found a shield of reflection before reaching Medusa's Island, checking Perseus's statue for one can be especially rewarding for a rogue, provided you are careful not to get stoned by Medusa.\nEntering the late game, rogues should continue to refine their primary attacks, enchanting their melee artifact weapon to +5 or +6 and enchanting their missiles as well. Silver daggers are often desirable missile weapons, but are exceedingly rare, and not worth a wish. \nIf you choose to try twoweaponing despite forfeiting the backstab bonus, good secondary weapon choices for Rogues are crysknives, silver sabers, katanas, and elven broadswords. Crysknives pair well with Magicbane, since you can train both weapon classes to Expert for the lowest to-hit and damage penalty. If you have Grayswandir, Stormbringer, or one of the Brands, you may prefer using secondary weapons from the same classes so you do not have to train a second weapon skill.\nSince rogues can use shields of reflection comfortably, they do not need silver dragon scale mail, which decides the GDSM versus SDSM debate in favor of gray dragon scale mail for this role. GDSM supplies the magic resistance that your quest artifact lacks, and frees the neck and cloak slots for other items. Alternately, you may choose SDSM if you have another source of magic resistance and you prefer not to wear a shield.\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1-2: Footpad\nBULLET::::- XL 3-5: Cutpurse\nBULLET::::- XL 6-9: Rogue\nBULLET::::- XL 10-13: Pilferer\nBULLET::::- XL 14-17: Robber\nBULLET::::- XL 18-21: Burglar\nBULLET::::- XL 22-25: Filcher\nBULLET::::- XL 26-29: Magsman/Magswoman\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Thief\nThe Rogue quest sees you fighting the Master Assassin for The Master Key of Thievery. Inspired by the profession you have chosen, there are lots of stealing monsters, traps, shapeshifters and challenges even to access the quest nemesis!\nIn versions of NetHack prior to 3.6.0 and some variants (including SLASH'EM) based on these versions, rogues could also get backstab damage with thrown weapons for each hit. This was considered unbalancing and removed in 3.6.0. \nSee Rogue(SLASH'EM).\nBULLET::::- Rogue (player monster)\n",
    "healer": "Healer\nThe Healer is one of the roles in NetHack. Healers can be humans or gnomes, and are always neutral. While the concept of a healer is ubiquitous, parts of the healer\u2019s game, such as the quest, are based on Greek legends. The guidebook says of them:\nBULLET::::- 1001 to 2000 gold pieces\nBULLET::::- a +0 scalpel\nBULLET::::- an uncursed +1 pair of leather gloves\nBULLET::::- 5 to 10 uncursed apples\nBULLET::::- a blessed spellbook of healing\nBULLET::::- a blessed spellbook of extra healing\nBULLET::::- a blessed spellbook of stone to flesh\nBULLET::::- 4 \u00d7 potion of healing\nBULLET::::- 4 \u00d7 potion of extra healing\nBULLET::::- wand of sleep (4 to 8 charges)\nBULLET::::- an uncursed stethoscope\nBULLET::::- 4% chance of uncursed oil lamp\nHealers gain the following intrinsics at these experience levels:\nBULLET::::- Level 1: Poison resistance\nBULLET::::- Level 15: Warning\nHealers start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Knife\" and \"Healing spells\".\nBecause healers start with a large quantity of gold, they can purchase a lot of protection from the Minetown\u2019s priest if they avoid gaining experience beforehand. A skilled (or lucky) player can loot Sokoban and reach Minetown\u2019s temple without landing a single blow. The loot can be increased by credit cloning.\nHealers are also best suited for the pacifist conduct.\nApplying a stethoscope to a monster will reveal its armor class, which in turn will give some idea of whether it has any enchanted armor. For example, if a dwarf in the Gnomish Mines has AC 4 or less, it probably has either a dwarvish mithril-coat or at least one enchanted piece of armor. This strategy is not exclusive to healers, but they are the only class to start with a stethoscope.\nHealers are restricted in the use of most powerful wielded weapons such as dwarvish mattocks and long swords. Your starting scalpel is equivalent to a rustproof, half-weight orcish dagger and is not considered a particularly good weapon. You might consider upgrading to a normal or elven dagger, both of which have better average damage versus small monsters. A quarterstaff might also be a good early choice for wielding since it trains the skill of your quest artifact, The Staff of Aesculapius.\nFor ranged weapons, Healers have four options: knives, darts, daggers and as of 3.6.1 the aklys, all of which have their advantages and disadvantages.\nKnives are easily trained with your starting scalpel and can be advanced to Expert. They are the only ranged weapon which allows Healers to multishot 2 at Skilled and 3 at Expert. However, the base damage for a knife is the same as a dart and knives are unlikely to be generated in large quantities in the early game. Soldiers, barrow wights, watchmen, mordor orcs and orc captains all have variable chances of carrying knives but it could take well into the game to put together a reasonable stack.\nDarts are also a good option. They are light, can be advanced to Expert and are plentiful in the early game from dart traps and monsters. They can also be poisoned with a potion of sickness, and the Healer's innate resistance protects against monsters throwing them back at you. On the other hand, only two of them can be multishot at Expert, they have the same low base damage as knives and are prone to breaking.\nDaggers provide benefits in the early game; they are common in the Gnomish Mines and have better damage than the scalpel, but they can only be advanced to Skilled and cannot be multishot at all. It is probably only worth training dagger skill if you are planning to get Magicbane later in the game.\nThe aklys tends to be plentiful early in The Mines due to the strength restrictions of the resident gnomes. It exhibits a Mjollnir-like behavior but with markedly less damage. It is however more damaging than your starting scalpel and should train-up quickly to skilled since it can be used as both a ranged and wielded weapon. Although relatively lightweight, it is made of iron and prone to corrosion.\nA useful technique for training skills is to find a gas spore with sufficient HP, maneuver it into a corridor, and hit it with your unskilled weapon. Gas spores usually have enough HP not to explode, but to be sure, apply your stethoscope to see when its hitpoints are close to zero. You can then cast your spell at the gas spore and resume pummelling it ineffectually until your skill goes up. Just be sure not to let it explode, as the blast will usually wipe out a low-level Healer (4-24 damage).\nWhen a healer reaches about level three, they can reliably cast stone to flesh, which can convert boulders into huge chunks of meat. Without the threat of starvation, players can adopt a very cautious and slow playing style with little penalty. A huge chunk of meat can be safely eaten when not Satiated, and will generally result in being \"oversatiated\". This state is not displayed (the status line remains at \"Satiated\") so avoid eating anything until your status is back to normal. Eating anything at all while oversatiated, even food with zero nutrition such as wraith corpses, will make you choke over your food and die unless you are wearing an amulet of life saving or magical breathing.\nStone to flesh can also convert rocks into meatballs, which work like miniature tripe rations for training the apport of pets. Additionally, the spell can remove troublesome boulders from passageways.\nAlthough healers have excellent HP growth, their fighting skills are initially poor. A well trained pet can quickly surpass its owner in battle prowess. Indeed, the ability to repeatedly heal yourself or a pet is a valuable asset throughout the game. Be wary of early metallic armor that can interfere with your casting success. The one possible exception to this rule might be gauntlets of power since they provide such a huge boost to damage and survivability for an early healer. And at higher experience levels, even metal gauntlets won't interfere with casting most emergency spells.\nThe very early game is quite difficult for most players. However, due to their starting equipment, a Healer should not be afraid of combat. A good strategy if not going for the protection racket or atheist conduct is to fight until somewhat damaged, then if after turn 300, pray. You will then be healed with a boost to your HP from your god.\nAnother very early game strategy for combat is to immediately quaff your potions of extra healing. As the health boost would take you above your maximum HP, this maximum will be boosted by 2 if the potion is uncursed, or 5 if it is blessed.\nThe Healer's quest nemesis, the Cyclops, can be tough if you attempt to fight him hand to hand while he is wielding the Staff of Aesculapius. Fortunately, he is vulnerable to wands of sleep or death, and healers always start with a wand of sleep. Also, the Cyclops respects Elbereth or a scroll of scare monster.\nThe healer quest has a large number of dragons. If one is lucky, a dragon on the first level will leave behind dragon scales which can be enchanted into dragon scale mail. Unfortunately, the large number of dragons makes the quest a dangerous place to visit without reflection, particularly if there are any black dragons around with their Disintegration breath.\nYou should upgrade to a unicorn horn (with which you can achieve Expert skill), then to your quest artifact, the Staff of Aesculapius, which has the life-draining powers of Stormbringer without its tendency to attack peaceful monsters. With all these changes of weapon, healers may find it useful to conserve skill slots, for example by not advancing their unicorn horn skill to Expert, so as to leave the slots free for the Staff later.\nYou also might want to pick up a silver weapon before entering Gehennom. If you find a silver dagger, take the time to enhance it to Skilled before entering Gehennom. Silver sabers and silver spears can both be raised to Basic skill as well. And of course you can always burn a wish for Grayswandir.\nGood non-silver weapons include Magicbane or a highly-enchanted crysknife.\nIn general, spellcasting for Healers is somewhat idiosyncratic. Although they have great natural spellcasting ability, they are restricted in all spell schools except healing. Thus, they have difficulty casting spells with level greater than 2. One milestone Healers should strive for is experience level 21, at which point they can reliably cast level 3 spells in restricted schools. Level 4 and higher spells will always be out of reach, unfortunately, as will the bonus effects of being Skilled or higher at a spell school.\nBecause of their low base spellcasting penalty, Healers can wear metal boots and cast reliably, or a metal helm and cast almost reliably (failure\u00a0rate\u00a0~3%). When casting emergency spells, Healers can wear gauntlets of power and still have 0% failure rates.\nOne interesting note on Healers is that with 18 wisdom and sufficiently high experience level and healing skill, they can cast their special spell () at 0% failure rate even while wearing metallic body armor and no robe. This is not true of any other role, even Wizards. However, it is rarely useful since by that point most players carry a unicorn horn, which offers the same effect without costing any power.\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1-2: Rhizotomist\nBULLET::::- XL 3-5: Empiric\nBULLET::::- XL 6-9: Embalmer\nBULLET::::- XL 10-13: Dresser\nBULLET::::- XL 14-17: Medicus ossium/Medica ossium\nBULLET::::- XL 18-21: Herbalist\nBULLET::::- XL 22-25: Magister/Magistra\nBULLET::::- XL 26-29: Physician\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Chirurgeon\nThe Healer quest sees you fighting the Cyclops for The Staff of Aesculapius.\nIn both FIQHack and xNetHack, several changes affect healers. First, quarterstavess give the player a bonus to spellcasting success rates like a robe, and a cursed staff doesn't prevent you from casting spells. (This helps healers who choose to wield their quest artifact.) Second, healers in FIQHack have a bonus regeneration of 0.33 HP per turn.\n",
    "baby gray dragon": "Dragon\nThe dragons, represented by the overall glyph , are a class of very powerful mid-game monster and are coveted for the scales they sometimes drop. With some superficial differences, they are nearly identical save for color. Each of them has a nasty breath attack associated with its resistance.

Baby dragons randomly occur only on those levels that are eligible for baby monsters; otherwise they can be created by hatching dragon eggs.\nEach dragon has a specific resistance associated with it. Eating some dragon corpses can give you the associated intrinsics; others can give you the extrinsic characteristic when you enchant their scales to make dragon scale mail. (Dragon corpses are very filling, so using a tinning kit is usually a good idea. Be aware that tinning still won't work on half eaten corpses and, at least for lawfuls, eating after being satiated abuses your wisdom.)

(The only other disintegration is wide-angle disintegration beams from angry gods, which can be survived only by being resistant, or avoided by being sensible regarding religion.)\nDisintegration resistance will protect both you and your armor. If a dragon's blast of disintegration hits you (or a monster), and you (or it) are neither resistant nor reflecting, it will destroy:\nBULLET::::1. a shield if worn, otherwise:\nBULLET::::2. body armor if worn (plus any cloak), otherwise:\nBULLET::::3. an amulet of life saving if worn; otherwise:\nBULLET::::4. you (or the monster victim), as the case may be.\nThe rebound can still kill you (or a monster) if your gear saved you from the direct hit.\nA gray dragon (or baby gray dragon) is often the eventual result of repeatedly displacing your pet onto a polymorph trap, because it is magic resistant, and hence will polymorph no further. However, it can still polymorph if it eats a chameleon or doppelganger corpse.\nThere is a guaranteed red dragon on the Plane of Fire. This is the only place in the game where a specific color dragon is generated, not counting Ixoth, the Knight quest nemesis.\nDragons will use their breath weapons only at range (i.e. more than one square from the character), meaning that if you can get close to within melee distance, you can avoid the dangerous attacks in favour of the relative \"safety\" of their physical melee attacks. This is useful for characters without magic cancellation, magic resistance, or reflection to avoid or negate their elemental fire, cold, lightning, poison, or disintegration beams.\nDragons are considered kebabable, able to be skewered, and you receive a +2 to-hit bonus when using a weapon that uses the spear or javelin skills.\nDragons are excellent pets in the early game if you ever get one. The easiest way to get a dragon pet is through a dragon egg; the egg may be obtained by polymorphing into any of the dragons and then sitting if your character is female. If you repeatedly displace your pet onto a polymorph trap you will often end up with a gray dragon, since they are magic-resistant and will not polymorph further.\nThe most recommendable colors for dragons are silver and gray; they are immune to death rays and silver ones also immune to disintegration, while gray ones are immune to polymorph traps. Yellow is a good option too due to stoning-resistance.\nPet dragons can be used as steeds with the advantages of flight, fighting strength, and carnivorousness, which makes them easy to feed. However, they are quite slow and will spend most of their time either catching up with you or eating corpses unless you make them fast (eg by zapping a wand of speed monster at them).\nBaby dragons generally possess the resistances of their adult forms. However, baby silver dragons do not possess reflection. They grant no intrinsics when eaten, they do not drop scales, and they do not have breath attacks. \nHowever, one can still use tame baby dragons to obtain scales and/or resistances. Pet baby dragons will eventually grow up into their adult forms, which can then be killed (possibly via conflict or by rendering them non-tame through abuse) for their scales and intrinsics. Obtaining pet baby dragons can be accomplished via controlled polymorph for a female character fairly easily: all dragons are oviparous, and baby dragons coming from laid eggs will be tame. A male character can use an amulet of change to swap genders, or he can repeatedly polymorph into a dragon using the spell or the ring until he changes sex.\nDragons have been substantially modified in UnNetHack. All dragons have been given new names and have their breaths, resistances, and colors randomized, with the exception of chromatic dragons, which possess all breaths, and all resistances except for magic resistance. As result it is impossible to predict breath type based on name or color.\nThis behavior has been made a bit more friendly in the current version - dragons are randomized at the start of the game, but all dragons of the same name/color are of the same type - identify one, identify all of that type. They auto-identify upon witnessing the breath attack. In addition, a new type of breath attack has been added - a lava breath that does heavy fire damage and melts walls instead of bouncing. \nGlowing dragon scales and scale mail function as an infinite light source, in addition to providing the resistance that glowing dragons possess in each individual game.

In addition, they have special AI that allows them to use their breath weapon in melee, and will try to move more intelligently in general to move in line to breath at you, or out of line when they can't breath, and flee to preserve survival. FIQHack also includes the deferred shimmering dragons from vanilla, who have innate displacement, a stun breath and whose scales confer displacement when worn.\nHack 1.0 has a dragon that does not have an explicit color. This early dragon breathes fire and its corpse confers fire resistance, making it equivalent to the modern red dragon. Back then, it was the only way to get intrinsic fire resistance, so it was quite likely that the player wouldn't have acquired it yet by the time they would see dragons. This, combined with the lack of reflection and fact that in earlier versions of NetHack, dragons were allowed to use their breath attack in melee (\"on top\" of their normal melee attacks), made them significantly more dangerous.\nNetHack 2.3e introduces all of the modern dragon types except silver. The corpse is still just a \"dead dragon\", without reference to the color, and eating it confers fire resistance, regardless of the type of dragon. Black dragon breath causes instadeath, and there is no reflection, disintegration resistance, or amulet of life saving, making genocide tempting; but fire resistance is necessary to enter Hell, and there's no way to genocide only black dragons.\nNetHack 3.0.0 introduces baby dragons, makes the corpses separate, and also introduces dragon scale mail. Dragon scale mail is obtained by polymorphing a dragon corpse. Reflection is now available and black dragon breath is toned down a bit. It also becomes possible to genocide only black dragons.\nNetHack 3.1.0 introduces dragon scales and with them the modern method of obtaining dragon scale mail.

This is the only place in the game where a specific color dragon is generated, not counting Ixoth, the Knight quest nemesis.\nDragons will use their breath weapons only at range (i.e. more than one square from the character), meaning that if you can get close to within melee distance, you can avoid the dangerous attacks in favour of the relative \"safety\" of their physical melee attacks.

The easiest way to get a dragon pet is through a dragon egg; the egg may be obtained by polymorphing into any of the dragons and then sitting if your character is female. If you repeatedly displace your pet onto a polymorph trap you will often end up with a gray dragon, since they are magic-resistant and will not polymorph further.\nThe most recommendable colors for dragons are silver and gray; they are immune to death rays and silver ones also immune to disintegration, while gray ones are immune to polymorph traps. Yellow is a good option too due to stoning-resistance.\nPet dragons can be used as steeds with the advantages of flight, fighting strength, and carnivorousness, which makes them easy to feed. However, they are quite slow and will spend most of their time either catching up with you or eating corpses unless you make them fast (eg by zapping a wand of speed monster at them).\nBaby dragons generally possess the resistances of their adult forms. However, baby silver dragons do not possess reflection. They grant no intrinsics when eaten, they do not drop scales, and they do not have breath attacks. \nHowever, one can still use tame baby dragons to obtain scales and/or resistances. Pet baby dragons will eventually grow up into their adult forms, which can then be killed (possibly via conflict or by rendering them non-tame through abuse) for their scales and intrinsics. Obtaining pet baby dragons can be accomplished via controlled polymorph for a female character fairly easily: all dragons are oviparous, and baby dragons coming from laid eggs will be tame. A male character can use an amulet of change to swap genders, or he can repeatedly polymorph into a dragon using the spell or the ring until he changes sex.\nDragons have been substantially modified in UnNetHack.

This, combined with the lack of reflection and fact that in earlier versions of NetHack, dragons were allowed to use their breath attack in melee (\"on top\" of their normal melee attacks), made them significantly more dangerous.\nNetHack 2.3e introduces all of the modern dragon types except silver. The corpse is still just a \"dead dragon\", without reference to the color, and eating it confers fire resistance, regardless of the type of dragon.

This is the only place in the game where a specific color dragon is generated, not counting Ixoth, the Knight quest nemesis.\nDragons will use their breath weapons only at range (i.e. more than one square from the character), meaning that if you can get close to within melee distance, you can avoid the dangerous attacks in favour of the relative \"safety\" of their physical melee attacks.

The easiest way to get a dragon pet is through a dragon egg; the egg may be obtained by polymorphing into any of the dragons and then sitting if your character is female. If you repeatedly displace your pet onto a polymorph trap you will often end up with a gray dragon, since they are magic-resistant and will not polymorph further.\nThe most recommendable colors for dragons are silver and gray; they are immune to death rays and silver ones also immune to disintegration, while gray ones are immune to polymorph traps. Yellow is a good option too due to stoning-resistance.\nPet dragons can be used as steeds with the advantages of flight, fighting strength, and carnivorousness, which makes them easy to feed. However, they are quite slow and will spend most of their time either catching up with you or eating corpses unless you make them fast (eg by zapping a wand of speed monster at them).\nBaby dragons generally possess the resistances of their adult forms. However, baby silver dragons do not possess reflection. They grant no intrinsics when eaten, they do not drop scales, and they do not have breath attacks. \nHowever, one can still use tame baby dragons to obtain scales and/or resistances. Pet baby dragons will eventually grow up into their adult forms, which can then be killed (possibly via conflict or by rendering them non-tame through abuse) for their scales and intrinsics. Obtaining pet baby dragons can be accomplished via controlled polymorph for a female character fairly easily: all dragons are oviparous, and baby dragons coming from laid eggs will be tame. A male character can use an amulet of change to swap genders, or he can repeatedly polymorph into a dragon using the spell or the ring until he changes sex.\nDragons have been substantially modified in UnNetHack.

This early dragon breathes fire and its corpse confers fire resistance, making it equivalent to the modern red dragon. Back then, it was the only way to get intrinsic fire resistance, so it was quite likely that the player wouldn't have acquired it yet by the time they would see dragons. This, combined with the lack of reflection and fact that in earlier versions of NetHack, dragons were allowed to use their breath attack in melee (\"on top\" of their normal melee attacks), made them significantly more dangerous.\nNetHack 2.3e introduces all of the modern dragon types except silver. The corpse is still just a \"dead dragon\", without reference to the color, and eating it confers fire resistance, regardless of the type of dragon.

The easiest way to get a dragon pet is through a dragon egg; the egg may be obtained by polymorphing into any of the dragons and then sitting if your character is female. If you repeatedly displace your pet onto a polymorph trap you will often end up with a gray dragon, since they are magic-resistant and will not polymorph further.\nThe most recommendable colors for dragons are silver and gray; they are immune to death rays and silver ones also immune to disintegration, while gray ones are immune to polymorph traps. Yellow is a good option too due to stoning-resistance.\nPet dragons can be used as steeds with the advantages of flight, fighting strength, and carnivorousness, which makes them easy to feed.

However, baby silver dragons do not possess reflection. They grant no intrinsics when eaten, they do not drop scales, and they do not have breath attacks. \nHowever, one can still use tame baby dragons to obtain scales and/or resistances. Pet baby dragons will eventually grow up into their adult forms, which can then be killed (possibly via conflict or by rendering them non-tame through abuse) for their scales and intrinsics. Obtaining pet baby dragons can be accomplished via controlled polymorph for a female character fairly easily: all dragons are oviparous, and baby dragons coming from laid eggs will be tame. A male character can use an amulet of change to swap genders, or he can repeatedly polymorph into a dragon using the spell or the ring until he changes sex.\nDragons have been substantially modified in UnNetHack.

Other powerful monsters may generate them with the summon nasties spell.\n!Dragon\n!Breath \"(4d6 unless otherwise noted)\"\n!Intrinsics/scales\n!Corpse conveys...\nBlack\ndisintegration\ndisintegration resistance\nsame (100%)\nBlue\nlightning\nshock resistance\nsame (100%)\nGray\nmagic missile\nmagic resistance\nnothing (magic resistance cannot be gained intrinsically)\nGreen\npoison\npoison resistance\nsame (100%)\nOrange\nsleep, 4d25 turns\nsleep resistance\nsame (100%)\nRed\nfire 6d6\nfire resistance\nsame (100%)\nSilver\ncold\nreflection and cold resistance; only reflection is provided by scales\nnothing (reflection cannot be gained intrinsically)\nWhite\ncold\ncold resistance\nsame (100%)\nYellow\nacid\nacid resistance and petrification resistance; only acid resistance is provided by scales\nnothing (neither resistance can be gained intrinsically)\nA black dragon is the only source of disintegration resistance in the game; this might make acquiring disintegration resistance tricky were it not for the fact that reflection is already a reliable defense against the black dragon's disintegration blasts. (The only other disintegration is wide-angle disintegration beams from angry gods, which can be survived only by being resistant, or avoided by being sensible regarding religion.)\nDisintegration resistance will protect both you and your armor. If a dragon's blast of disintegration hits you (or a monster), and you (or it) are neither resistant nor reflecting, it will destroy:\nBULLET::::1. a shield if worn, otherwise:\nBULLET::::2. body armor if worn (plus any cloak), otherwise:\nBULLET::::3. an amulet of life saving if worn; otherwise:\nBULLET::::4. you (or the monster victim), as the case may be.\nThe rebound can still kill you (or a monster) if your gear saved you from the direct hit.\nA gray dragon (or baby gray dragon) is often the eventual result of repeatedly displacing your pet onto a polymorph trap, because it is magic resistant, and hence will polymorph no further. However, it can still polymorph if it eats a chameleon or doppelganger corpse.\nThere is a guaranteed red dragon on the Plane of Fire. This is the only place in the game where a specific color dragon is generated, not counting Ixoth, the Knight quest nemesis.\nDragons will use their breath weapons only at range (i.e. more than one square from the character), meaning that if you can get close to within melee distance, you can avoid the dangerous attacks in favour of the relative \"safety\" of their physical melee attacks. This is useful for characters without magic cancellation, magic resistance, or reflection to avoid or negate their elemental fire, cold, lightning, poison, or disintegration beams.\nDragons are considered kebabable, able to be skewered, and you receive a +2 to-hit bonus when using a weapon that uses the spear or javelin skills.\nDragons are excellent pets in the early game if you ever get one. The easiest way to get a dragon pet is through a dragon egg; the egg may be obtained by polymorphing into any of the dragons and then sitting if your character is female. If you repeatedly displace your pet onto a polymorph trap you will often end up with a gray dragon, since they are magic-resistant and will not polymorph further.\nThe most recommendable colors for dragons are silver and gray; they are immune to death rays and silver ones also immune to disintegration, while gray ones are immune to polymorph traps. Yellow is a good option too due to stoning-resistance.\nPet dragons can be used as steeds with the advantages of flight, fighting strength, and carnivorousness, which makes them easy to feed. However, they are quite slow and will spend most of their time either catching up with you or eating corpses unless you make them fast (eg by zapping a wand of speed monster at them).\nBaby dragons generally possess the resistances of their adult forms. However, baby silver dragons do not possess reflection. They grant no intrinsics when eaten, they do not drop scales, and they do not have breath attacks. \nHowever, one can still use tame baby dragons to obtain scales and/or resistances. Pet baby dragons will eventually grow up into their adult forms, which can then be killed (possibly via conflict or by rendering them non-tame through abuse) for their scales and intrinsics. Obtaining pet baby dragons can be accomplished via controlled polymorph for a female character fairly easily: all dragons are oviparous, and baby dragons coming from laid eggs will be tame. A male character can use an amulet of change to swap genders, or he can repeatedly polymorph into a dragon using the spell or the ring until he changes sex.\nDragons have been substantially modified in UnNetHack. All dragons have been given new names and have their breaths, resistances, and colors randomized, with the exception of chromatic dragons, which possess all breaths, and all resistances except for magic resistance. As result it is impossible to predict breath type based on name or color.\nThis behavior has been made a bit more friendly in the current version - dragons are randomized at the start of the game, but all dragons of the same name/color are of the same type - identify one, identify all of that type. They auto-identify upon witnessing the breath attack. In addition, a new type of breath attack has been added - a lava breath that does heavy fire damage and melts walls instead of bouncing. \nGlowing dragon scales and scale mail function as an infinite light source, in addition to providing the resistance that glowing dragons possess in each individual game. Chromatic dragon scales and scale mail provide all resistances (including reflection) except magic resistance.\nThe following are the names given to random dragons in Unnethack:\nBULLET::::- leviathan\nBULLET::::- tatzelworm\nBULLET::::- lindworm\nBULLET::::- guivre\nBULLET::::- sarkany\nBULLET::::- amphitere\nBULLET::::- wyvern\nBULLET::::- draken\nBULLET::::- sirrush\nBULLET::::- glowing dragon\nSLASH'EM also added two new dragons, the Shimmering and Deep variants, whose scales give displacement and drain resistance respectively. The hydra and wyvern monsters also use the glyph.\nFIQHack dragons are significantly faster (speed 20 instead of 9) and claw attacks are 1d8 instead of 1d4. In addition, they have special AI that allows them to use their breath weapon in melee, and will try to move more intelligently in general to move in line to breath at you, or out of line when they can't breath, and flee to preserve survival. FIQHack also includes the deferred shimmering dragons from vanilla, who have innate displacement, a stun breath and whose scales confer displacement when worn.\nHack 1.0 has a dragon that does not have an explicit color. This early dragon breathes fire and its corpse confers fire resistance, making it equivalent to the modern red dragon. Back then, it was the only way to get intrinsic fire resistance, so it was quite likely that the player wouldn't have acquired it yet by the time they would see dragons. This, combined with the lack of reflection and fact that in earlier versions of NetHack, dragons were allowed to use their breath attack in melee (\"on top\" of their normal melee attacks), made them significantly more dangerous.\nNetHack 2.3e introduces all of the modern dragon types except silver. The corpse is still just a \"dead dragon\", without reference to the color, and eating it confers fire resistance, regardless of the type of dragon. Black dragon breath causes instadeath, and there is no reflection, disintegration resistance, or amulet of life saving, making genocide tempting; but fire resistance is necessary to enter Hell, and there's no way to genocide only black dragons.\nNetHack 3.0.0 introduces baby dragons, makes the corpses separate, and also introduces dragon scale mail. Dragon scale mail is obtained by polymorphing a dragon corpse. Reflection is now available and black dragon breath is toned down a bit. It also becomes possible to genocide only black dragons.\nNetHack 3.1.0 introduces dragon scales and with them the modern method of obtaining dragon scale mail. This version also adds the Quests and with them the Chromatic Dragon and Ixoth. Fire resistance is not necessary to enter Gehennom.\nNetHack 3.3.0 adds the silver dragon and corresponding scales.\n",
    "chickatrice": "Cockatrice\nThe cockatrice, , is one of the more complex creatures in Nethack, and is generally considered to be a real nuisance, as it is often the source of many YASDs. It can turn you to stone instantaneously if you touch it (or even its corpse) with your bare hands (or any other part of your body). However, if you are wearing gloves, you can pick its corpse up and wield it as a weapon, turning enemies to stone instantaneously; the cockatrice corpse has been nicknamed the rubber chicken by the players who like to use it in this way. This is still extremely dangerous, as falling in any manner will cause you to touch it. Monsters with gloves can also wield cockatrice corpses against you.\nThe baby version of a cockatrice is a chickatrice, , and is similarly dangerous; while they may appear earlier than cockatrices, chickatrices are much weaker, rarer, and less likely to leave a corpse. Chickatrices and cockatrices are often collectively referred to as footrices, particularly in reference to the stoning abilities they and their corpses possess.\nIn addition to normal monster generation, floors below DL 17 may rarely generate a nest full of cockatrices as a special room.\nIf you hear the cockatrice's hissing, there is a chance that you may begin turning to stone. If you immediately act to counter this process, you can save your life, but any intrinsic speed will be lost. The hissing attack always succeeds during a new moon unless you are carrying a lizard corpse.\nFor a cockatrice to start turning you to stone, the following must all happen:\nBULLET::::1. The cockatrice must touch you with its petrifying touch attack. (\"The cockatrice touches you.\")\nBULLET::::2. Then, there is a chance the cockatrice will hiss at you if it has not been cancelled. (\"You hear the cockatrice's hissing!\")\nBULLET::::3. Finally, there is a 10% chance (or 100% if today is a new moon and you are not carrying a lizard corpse) that you will begin turning to stone. (\"You are slowing down.\" at the end of the current game turn)\nMagic cancellation will not protect you against the hiss, although cancelling the cockatrice will prevent it from hissing (\"You hear a cough from the cockatrice!\"). Good AC can prevent a cockatrice from touching you. Note that cancellation's only effect on cockatrices is to block their hissing attack; it does not protect you against petrification due to contact with the cockatrice, living or dead. To prepare for the loss of intrinsic speed, you may tin the corpse of a quantum mechanic and eat the tin after stopping the stoning process, or zap yourself with a wand of speed monster.\nThe following list gives the ways a cockatrice or chickatrice can kill you, and what there is to be done about it. (Except where otherwise stated, \"cockatrice\" will refer to both cockatrices and chickatrices.) This list may not be exhaustive. All methods are instantly fatal and assume you are not stoning-resistant, unless noted. Wearing an amulet of life saving will save you if you are petrified.\nBULLET::::- Get hit by a monster wielding it (delayed death). If you've killed a cockatrice near an enemy that can wield weapons, there is a high chance that one wearing gloves will pick up the corpse and attempt to stone you with it. Be on alert for messages involving the corpse being wielded. If you are blind and cannot see this information, it is best to assume they have wielded it. If an enemy has the corpse and you cannot kill it, you are advised to make your way to another level and wait for the corpse to rot away, which will take place in 250 turns. If a moat is nearby and you are wearing boots, you can kick the corpse into the water to make it inaccessible.\nBULLET::::- Eat it. Gaining the food appraisal intrinsic warns you before eating dangerous food, including food that will petrify you. ('This smells like it could be something very dangerous!') The intrinsic is gained by reading a blessed scroll of food detection, or casting 'detect food' at skilled or expert in divination spells. It lasts for one warning. If you have stoning resistance, it will give you a message 'This tastes just like chicken!' Keep food (especially cockatrice corpses) out of slot 'y'; this will help avoid accidentally eating something you shouldn't.\nBULLET::::- Pick it up. If you are polymorphed into a creature that lacks hands and can pick up objects, you will also be stoned.\nBULLET::::- Exception: it's safe to pick up with a bullwhip.\nBULLET::::- Put it into or take it out of a container.\nBULLET::::- Try to throw or fire it.\nBULLET::::- Wield the corpse.\nBULLET::::- Snag it with a bullwhip or grappling hook.\nBULLET::::- Steal it (for example, when polymorphed into a nymph).\nBULLET::::- Sacrifice it. This even happens when it's already lying on the altar.\nBULLET::::- Tin the corpse.\nBULLET::::- Feeling the corpse when you move or teleport onto the square containing the corpse when not using .\nBULLET::::- Cease levitating over it when not using .\nBULLET::::- Look (using ':' at the square containing it).\nBULLET::::- Get expelled from an engulfing monster on a square containing the corpse when not using .\nBULLET::::- Throw it upwards (direction ). The death message is \"petrified by elementary physics\" (what goes up, must come down).\nBULLET::::- Kick it.\nBULLET::::- Trip over it while fumbling, as of NetHack 3.6.0.\nBULLET::::- Fall down the stairs. This happens if you are burdened or worse, are fumbling, or are punished. However, you will never fall down the stairs if you are flying.\nBULLET::::- Fall down a pit, hole or a trapdoor, including jumping into them while flying.\nBULLET::::- Fall into a chasm created by a drum of earthquake.\nBULLET::::- Fall into a pit created by stepping on a landmine. If you are flying or levitating, you can pass over these without falling (except in Sokoban). Flying won't stop you from triggering the landmine, but it will prevent you from falling into the created pit. Jumping down a hole or trapdoor while flying \"will\" stone you.\nBULLET::::- Fall onto a sink while levitating.\nBULLET::::- Faint from hunger and fall on the corpse.\nBULLET::::- Lose your gloves to disintegration by a scroll of destroy armor.\nBULLET::::- Lose your gloves to overenchantment (or underenchantment) by a scroll of enchant armor. If the enchantment on the gloves is +4 or higher, reading a non-cursed scroll of enchant armor may destroy them. If the enchantment is \u22124 or lower, reading a cursed scroll of enchant armor may do the same.\nBULLET::::- Lose your gloves to the monster spell destroy armor. Magic resistance protects you from this spell.\nBULLET::::- Have your gloves taken off by a foocubus. You have chance of having the option to stop a foocubus from removing an item of armor. Cancelling them stops the seduction attacks altogether. Nymphs and monkeys cannot steal your gloves if you're holding a weapon; they will try to take your weapon first, petrifying themselves if successful. The corpse can be retrieved by breaking the resulting statue.\nBULLET::::- Change to a non-stoning-resistant form. Polymorph control or unchanging can prevent this. Reaching zero HP will change you back to your normal, non-resistant form if you don't have unchanging, and kill you if you do.\nBULLET::::- Attack (strike, touch, or claw) it with bare, ungloved hands.\nBULLET::::- Due to a bug, even the command will not be safe if the cockatrice is shown only a warning symbol.\nBULLET::::- Attack it with ungloved hands, wielding a potion.\nBULLET::::- Kick it without wearing boots (as a monster attack or as a command).\nBULLET::::- Bite or sting it (monster attack).\nBULLET::::- Headbutt it without wearing a helmet (monster attack).\nBULLET::::- Hug it without gloves and a cloak (monster attack).\nBULLET::::- Suck its brain with tentacles (as mind flayer or master mind flayer).\nBULLET::::- Attack it while polymorphed into a foocubus (\"You smile at the cockatrice seductively. You turn to stone...\").\nBULLET::::- Swallow it whole (as trapper, lurker above, or purple worm).\nBULLET::::- Without gloves, attempt to saddle it.\nBULLET::::- Without gloves, attempt to untrap it from a pit.\nBULLET::::- Hear its hissing (delayed death). See for details.\nBULLET::::- Ride an animal that steps on a polymorph trap and turns into a cockatrice. Your magic resistance protects ridden monsters against polytraps.\nBULLET::::- Get reduced to zero HP by its attacks. This will kill you normally, but if you weren't petrification resistant, you will leave a statue instead of a ghost in your bones file. If you were polymorphed into a stoning-resistant form while wearing an amulet of unchanging, you leave a ghost instead.\nIf you have no weapon or gloves, or are polymorphed into a form which has an unusual attack, cockatrices should not be directly attacked; attack them with ranged weapons or spells. If you suck a cockatrice's brain, you turn to stone. If your life is saved, you still suffer the delayed death stoning effects. Minotaurs are the only headbutters capable of wearing helmets (and even then, only cloth and leather hats). Salamanders are the only huggers capable of wearing both gloves and a cloak.\nBULLET::::- Eat a tin of cockatrice meat.\nBULLET::::- Eat a cockatrice egg (delayed death).\nBULLET::::- Get hit by a cockatrice egg thrown by a monster (delayed death).\nBULLET::::- Without a helmet, throw a cockatrice egg in the air (direction ; \"not\" a delayed death).\nBULLET::::- Without gloves, smash a potion of polymorph over a monster, turning it into a cockatrice. (This is bug #C343-31, fixed May 2004)\nA cockatrice corpse is an extremely powerful weapon, but can easily backfire and thus should be used with some caution. To avoid falling in an unknown pit, you should unwield it or be levitating when moving around in places that might have traps. Even if you are levitating and not fumbling (highly recommended), you should stay away from sinks, nymphs and foocubi to be perfectly safe. (But 20 Charisma makes foocubi safe.) Some creatures are immune to stoning, and golems turn into powerful stone golems that can easily annihilate a character in the early game. So have a different weapon ready to use, and never stone a golem in the early game.\nDue to a minor bug, players polymorphed into a jabberwock will not stone monsters with a wielded cockatrice corpse.\nBefore Hack 1.0.3, a successful hissing attack was an instadeath; the only safe way to fight a cockatrice was with ranged weapons. The effect of the new moon first appeared in Hack 1.0.2.\nWishing for footrice corpses can sometimes be a good idea when fighting tough monsters or a multitude of them. A good Astral Plane wish would be a blessed partly eaten chickatrice corpse\u2014chickatrice corpses are lighter than cockatrices, and partly eaten ones are lighter still. All Quest nemeses and the endgame riders are stoning resistant.\nHere is a quick list of monsters that can be good candidates for stoning.\nBULLET::::- Moloch's priests and the high priest (especially in Moloch's Sanctum and the Astral Plane)\nBULLET::::- Demon princes and lords (except Juiblex, who is stone resistant)\nBULLET::::- The Wizard of Yendor\nBULLET::::- Angelic beings, including Archons\nBULLET::::- Mind flayers\nBULLET::::- Liches\nIt's always a good idea to save up a couple of extra charges on your wand of wishing just in case.

The relation between basilisks and cockatrices is unclear; sometimes they are used as synonyms, but other times a basilisk is a different monster.\n",
    "aligned priest": "Priest\nPriest (priestess if female) is one of the roles in NetHack, capable of playing any alignment as a human, or restricted to chaotic as an elf. A priest's religion is chosen randomly from the pantheons of the other roles. A human priest is therefore capable of representing any of the gods in the game (who send mortals after the amulet, that is). According to the guidebook:\nPriests start with the following items:\nBULLET::::- a blessed +1 mace\nBULLET::::- a +0 robe\nBULLET::::- a +0 small shield (like those of aligned priests)\nBULLET::::- 1\u20132 cloves of garlic\nBULLET::::- 1\u20132 sprigs of wolfsbane\nBULLET::::- 2 random spellbooks of level 3 or lower (suitable for priests: clerical, divination, or healing spells)\nBULLET::::- 4 potions of holy water\nBULLET::::- a chance at one of the following:\nBULLET::::- an oil lamp (9% chance)\nBULLET::::- a magic marker (10% chance)\nBULLET::::- If an elf, a random non-magical instrument.\nPriests gain the following intrinsics at these experience levels:\nBULLET::::- Level 15: Warning\nBULLET::::- Level 20: Fire resistance\nPriests start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Mace\" and \"Clerical spells\". The spellcasting skill is always \"Clerical\", no matter what spellbooks a character starts with, because the initial spellcasting skills are hardcoded in the function \"skill_init\" in and are independent of the starting inventory.\nOne distinct advantage enjoyed by the clergy is the ability to ascertain beatitude independently of their pets. Priests automatically see the beatitude of all objects. If no BUC is shown, that means uncursed. (You can force the game to include the \"uncursed\" descriptor by setting codice_1 in your options.)\nPriests can #turn undead, which can be helpful in their quest, but should do so carefully.\nOne disadvantage of the Priest is their weapon skill set. Priests can't gain skill in any edged weapons, and can't multishot any ranged weapons. Combined with no skill in the attack spells, this makes it hard for priests to find a good way to kill monsters.\nInstead, a Priest's best ranged option early game is the aklys, which they can pick up in the mines and can advance to up to Expert. Skill and enchantment investments on the aklys can be useful for the entire game.\nThe starting +1 mace is slightly better than a +0 long sword at Basic skill against small monsters. It is much less effective against large monsters, but these typically appear later. Like any character, a Priest will want to sacrifice for an artifact weapon as soon as possible.\nMetallic armor and shields are worth wearing to get your AC down; your starting spells don't generally need to be cast quickly, so when you do need to cast them you can find a quiet spot and disrobe. You will want to switch to non-metallic armor with a good AC as it becomes available.\nA priest starts with a robe which aids spellcasting, and can use their potions of holy water to bless spellbooks they find, thus gaining more spells. However, they may have better uses for holy water.\nA priest should focus on melee combat because most of their starting spells aren't useful in a fight. However, they are very capable of casting low-level spells such as sleep and force bolt.\nThe most useful combat spells that a priest can start with are protection and healing. Utility spells, especially identify can also give a priest a significant advantage once they are able to cast them.\nPriests' ability to tell the beatitude of items and their starting holy water gives them advantages in the early game:\nBULLET::::- They can identify which weapons, armor, and rings are safe to equip even if they have lost their pet. Another character who cannot pet-test must drag everything to an altar.\nBULLET::::- They can more easily get the more useful blessed effects of scrolls such as identify, genocide, enchant armor, and enchant weapon.\nBULLET::::- They can remove curses with holy water or by blessing scrolls of remove curse.\nBULLET::::- They can get an early wish if they find a magic lamp; they may wish to go to Mine Town early to see if there is one to buy.\nBULLET::::- Priests can easily uncurse items they find in bones files.\nConsider stashing at least one of your starting potions of holy water as early as possible, to keep from losing it to cold/fire/lightning attacks. As long as you have one potion, you can make more at will.\nIf you manage to get an early wish, dragon scale mail is generally more useful than a weapon, because AC and non-metallic body armor are useful things for a priest to have.\nYou should #turn undead only if you are certain that there are no non-undead monsters nearby.\nPriests are well suited to the atheist conduct, because they need not use altars to ascertain beatitude.\nLycanthropy can be dealt with using your starting wolfsbane. Removing curses is easy with the starting holy water.\nUsing #turn will break atheist conduct, as will using #chat on a priest (monster).\nThe quest has mostly weaker zombies and only a few strong monsters, and the large number of graveyards contain many boxes full of items. There is more treasure on this quest than any other. Drain resistance or at least magic cancellation of 3 is useful to prevent level drain from wraiths and vampires. If you aren't level 14 yet but you have a means of creating monsters, you can gain levels by creating wraiths on the home level and luring them back through the portal.\nThe unaligned altar can be converted and used for sacrificing, but monster generation is low and most generated monsters are undead and cannot be sacrificed. In version 3.6.0 and later, you can get corpses by kicking the trees on the home level to summon killer bees. \nSome priests that get to the Castle will be strong enough to face the monsters in direct combat, or use the passtune to crush more difficult monsters with the drawbridge. Another option is to enter the Castle by levitating around to the back and entering that way, allowing difficult monsters to advance and drop through the trap doors to the Valley of the Dead, while killing the easier ones.\nPolypiling may be useful in the midgame, should you get a spellbook of polymorph or a wand of polymorph, to get more useful spellbooks that you haven't found yet.\nExcept for attack spells, Priests are decent spell-casters. They can advance to expert in clerical, divination and healing, but are restricted in other classes. Note that their spellcasting prowess is based on Wisdom, not Intelligence (but the odds of learning a new spell still depend on Intelligence).\nSkill slots are not in short supply because a Priest has few weapon skills, and may gain many levels from wraith corpses in the quest. Advancing divinations to Skilled enhances the effects of spells like , , and identify, but advancing the school to Expert only improves spell failure rates.\nYou can learn simple attack spells (like force bolt or drain life) and cast them with 0% failure rate, especially with the Mitre of Holiness. Magic missile is especially useful at high levels, as its damage scales up with your level (and, due to the wraiths in the quest, it is easy to increase your level).\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1\u20132: Aspirant\nBULLET::::- XL 3\u20135: Acolyte\nBULLET::::- XL 6\u20139: Adept\nBULLET::::- XL 10\u201313: Priest/Priestess\nBULLET::::- XL 14\u201317: Curate\nBULLET::::- XL 18\u201321: Canon/Canoness\nBULLET::::- XL 22\u201325: Lama\nBULLET::::- XL 26\u201329: Patriarch/Matriarch\nBULLET::::- XL 30: High Priest/High Priestess\nNalzok, the Priest quest nemesis, is quite tough, but he respects Elbereth and the scroll of scare monster. The quest is rather boring, but extremely profitable. All the levels contain several graveyards with wraiths and chests full of goodies. The Locate level may also contain several sleeping foocubi, which you should not disturb until you are able to utilize them without the risk of negative effects. Given all the graveyards and sleeping monsters, some source of stealth is advisable before attempting this quest.\nThe quest artifact is The Mitre of Holiness. While even an ordinary helm of brilliance is a great thing, the mitre additionally allows you to regain your power, gives fire resistance and halves damage from the undead and most demons. However, unlike many quest artifacts, it doesn't confer magic resistance, so you have to get that from a different source.\nIn SLASH'EM, Priests can be doppelgangers, drow, elves, hobbits, or humans.\nBULLET::::- blessed +0 mace\nBULLET::::- blessed +0 robe (note that in SLASH'EM, an ordinary robe does not enhance spellcasting; that requires a robe of power)\nBULLET::::- blessed +2 small shield\nBULLET::::- 1\u20132 blessed cloves of garlic\nBULLET::::- 1\u20132 blessed sprigs of wolfsbane\nBULLET::::- spellbook of healing\nBULLET::::- spellbook of ,\nBULLET::::- random blessed scroll\nBULLET::::- 4 potions of holy water\nBULLET::::- 10% chance of magic marker, otherwise 10% chance of light source (50% chance of oil lamp, 50% chance of torches)\nPriest spell skills are different than in vanilla.

It is not terribly useful as a main weapon, but makes a good secondary weapon to use against liches and vampire mages. Make sure to enchant it to be able to hit undead with enchantment resistance!\nLawful Priests can try to use Skullcrusher, which can be gotten by sacrifice. If you are good at unmounted polearm tactics, then Reaper can be another option. The previously-good wish, the Sceptre of Might, is a much weaker weapon in SLASH'EM; it now does a flat +3 to hit and +5 to damage against cross-aligned, instead of double damage.\nNeutral Priests do not get any new options and should go for Mjollnir (now a heavy hammer) or the Staff of Aesculapius.\nChaotic Priests can use the Bat from Hell, which can by gotten by sacrifice. They can also use Plague or Hellfire for ranged combat; both may be obtained through sacrifice. Arrows shot from Plague are automatically poisoned, and bolts shot from Hellfire explode and deal fire damage.\n",

According to the guidebook:\nPriests start with the following items:\nBULLET::::- a blessed +1 mace\nBULLET::::- a +0 robe\nBULLET::::- a +0 small shield (like those of aligned priests)\nBULLET::::- 1\u20132 cloves of garlic\nBULLET::::- 1\u20132 sprigs of wolfsbane\nBULLET::::- 2 random spellbooks of level 3 or lower (suitable for priests: clerical, divination, or healing spells)\nBULLET::::- 4 potions of holy water\nBULLET::::- a chance at one of the following:\nBULLET::::- an oil lamp (9% chance)\nBULLET::::- a magic marker (10% chance)\nBULLET::::- If an elf, a random non-magical instrument.\nPriests gain the following intrinsics at these experience levels:\nBULLET::::- Level 15: Warning\nBULLET::::- Level 20: Fire resistance\nPriests start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Mace\" and \"Clerical spells\". The spellcasting skill is always \"Clerical\", no matter what spellbooks a character starts with, because the initial spellcasting skills are hardcoded in the function \"skill_init\" in and are independent of the starting inventory.\nOne distinct advantage enjoyed by the clergy is the ability to ascertain beatitude independently of their pets. Priests automatically see the beatitude of all objects. If no BUC is shown, that means uncursed. (You can force the game to include the \"uncursed\" descriptor by setting codice_1 in your options.)\nPriests can #turn undead, which can be helpful in their quest, but should do so carefully.\nOne disadvantage of the Priest is their weapon skill set. Priests can't gain skill in any edged weapons, and can't multishot any ranged weapons. Combined with no skill in the attack spells, this makes it hard for priests to find a good way to kill monsters.\nInstead, a Priest's best ranged option early game is the aklys, which they can pick up in the mines and can advance to up to Expert. Skill and enchantment investments on the aklys can be useful for the entire game.\nThe starting +1 mace is slightly better than a +0 long sword at Basic skill against small monsters. It is much less effective against large monsters, but these typically appear later. Like any character, a Priest will want to sacrifice for an artifact weapon as soon as possible.\nMetallic armor and shields are worth wearing to get your AC down; your starting spells don't generally need to be cast quickly, so when you do need to cast them you can find a quiet spot and disrobe. You will want to switch to non-metallic armor with a good AC as it becomes available.\nA priest starts with a robe which aids spellcasting, and can use their potions of holy water to bless spellbooks they find, thus gaining more spells. However, they may have better uses for holy water.\nA priest should focus on melee combat because most of their starting spells aren't useful in a fight. However, they are very capable of casting low-level spells such as sleep and force bolt.\nThe most useful combat spells that a priest can start with are protection and healing. Utility spells, especially identify can also give a priest a significant advantage once they are able to cast them.\nPriests' ability to tell the beatitude of items and their starting holy water gives them advantages in the early game:\nBULLET::::- They can identify which weapons, armor, and rings are safe to equip even if they have lost their pet. Another character who cannot pet-test must drag everything to an altar.\nBULLET::::- They can more easily get the more useful blessed effects of scrolls such as identify, genocide, enchant armor, and enchant weapon.\nBULLET::::- They can remove curses with holy water or by blessing scrolls of remove curse.\nBULLET::::- They can get an early wish if they find a magic lamp; they may wish to go to Mine Town early to see if there is one to buy.\nBULLET::::- Priests can easily uncurse items they find in bones files.\nConsider stashing at least one of your starting potions of holy water as early as possible, to keep from losing it to cold/fire/lightning attacks. As long as you have one potion, you can make more at will.\nIf you manage to get an early wish, dragon scale mail is generally more useful than a weapon, because AC and non-metallic body armor are useful things for a priest to have.\nYou should #turn undead only if you are certain that there are no non-undead monsters nearby.\nPriests are well suited to the atheist conduct, because they need not use altars to ascertain beatitude.\nLycanthropy can be dealt with using your starting wolfsbane. Removing curses is easy with the starting holy water.\nUsing #turn will break atheist conduct, as will using #chat on a priest (monster).\nThe quest has mostly weaker zombies and only a few strong monsters, and the large number of graveyards contain many boxes full of items. There is more treasure on this quest than any other. Drain resistance or at least magic cancellation of 3 is useful to prevent level drain from wraiths and vampires. If you aren't level 14 yet but you have a means of creating monsters, you can gain levels by creating wraiths on the home level and luring them back through the portal.\nThe unaligned altar can be converted and used for sacrificing, but monster generation is low and most generated monsters are undead and cannot be sacrificed. In version 3.6.0 and later, you can get corpses by kicking the trees on the home level to summon killer bees. \nSome priests that get to the Castle will be strong enough to face the monsters in direct combat, or use the passtune to crush more difficult monsters with the drawbridge. Another option is to enter the Castle by levitating around to the back and entering that way, allowing difficult monsters to advance and drop through the trap doors to the Valley of the Dead, while killing the easier ones.\nPolypiling may be useful in the midgame, should you get a spellbook of polymorph or a wand of polymorph, to get more useful spellbooks that you haven't found yet.\nExcept for attack spells, Priests are decent spell-casters. They can advance to expert in clerical, divination and healing, but are restricted in other classes. Note that their spellcasting prowess is based on Wisdom, not Intelligence (but the odds of learning a new spell still depend on Intelligence).\nSkill slots are not in short supply because a Priest has few weapon skills, and may gain many levels from wraith corpses in the quest. Advancing divinations to Skilled enhances the effects of spells like , , and identify, but advancing the school to Expert only improves spell failure rates.\nYou can learn simple attack spells (like force bolt or drain life) and cast them with 0% failure rate, especially with the Mitre of Holiness. Magic missile is especially useful at high levels, as its damage scales up with your level (and, due to the wraiths in the quest, it is easy to increase your level).\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1\u20132: Aspirant\nBULLET::::- XL 3\u20135: Acolyte\nBULLET::::- XL 6\u20139: Adept\nBULLET::::- XL 10\u201313: Priest/Priestess\nBULLET::::- XL 14\u201317: Curate\nBULLET::::- XL 18\u201321: Canon/Canoness\nBULLET::::- XL 22\u201325: Lama\nBULLET::::- XL 26\u201329: Patriarch/Matriarch\nBULLET::::- XL 30: High Priest/High Priestess\nNalzok, the Priest quest nemesis, is quite tough, but he respects Elbereth and the scroll of scare monster.

The Locate level may also contain several sleeping foocubi, which you should not disturb until you are able to utilize them without the risk of negative effects. Given all the graveyards and sleeping monsters, some source of stealth is advisable before attempting this quest.\nThe quest artifact is The Mitre of Holiness. While even an ordinary helm of brilliance is a great thing, the mitre additionally allows you to regain your power, gives fire resistance and halves damage from the undead and most demons. However, unlike many quest artifacts, it doesn't confer magic resistance, so you have to get that from a different source.\nIn SLASH'EM, Priests can be doppelgangers, drow, elves, hobbits, or humans.\nBULLET::::- blessed +0 mace\nBULLET::::- blessed +0 robe (note that in SLASH'EM, an ordinary robe does not enhance spellcasting; that requires a robe of power)\nBULLET::::- blessed +2 small shield\nBULLET::::- 1\u20132 blessed cloves of garlic\nBULLET::::- 1\u20132 blessed sprigs of wolfsbane\nBULLET::::- spellbook of healing\nBULLET::::- spellbook of ,\nBULLET::::- random blessed scroll\nBULLET::::- 4 potions of holy water\nBULLET::::- 10% chance of magic marker, otherwise 10% chance of light source (50% chance of oil lamp, 50% chance of torches)\nPriest spell skills are different than in vanilla.

It is not terribly useful as a main weapon, but makes a good secondary weapon to use against liches and vampire mages. Make sure to enchant it to be able to hit undead with enchantment resistance!\nLawful Priests can try to use Skullcrusher, which can be gotten by sacrifice. If you are good at unmounted polearm tactics, then Reaper can be another option. The previously-good wish, the Sceptre of Might, is a much weaker weapon in SLASH'EM; it now does a flat +3 to hit and +5 to damage against cross-aligned, instead of double damage.\nNeutral Priests do not get any new options and should go for Mjollnir (now a heavy hammer) or the Staff of Aesculapius.\nChaotic Priests can use the Bat from Hell, which can by gotten by sacrifice. They can also use Plague or Hellfire for ranged combat; both may be obtained through sacrifice. Arrows shot from Plague are automatically poisoned, and bolts shot from Hellfire explode and deal fire damage.\n",

    "mind flayer": "Mind flayer\nThe mind flayer, , and master mind flayer, , are especially perilous monsters in \"NetHack\". They are depicted with a humanoid body, an octopus-like head, and four tentacles around a lamprey-like mouth. Mind flayers possess flight and telepathy, as well as both see invisible and infravision. Mind flayers are capable of using the same weapons, armor and wands as the player, and are always generated hostile. They share a colored glyph with the dwarf king, .\nMind flayers can use their tentacles to eat your brain, decreasing your intelligence; this may result in developing amnesia and, in the worst cases, perishing as your last thoughts fade away from fatal intelligence drain. You can sense the presence of mind flayers remotely via \"a faint wave of psychic energy\"; if you have telepathy, they can sense yours. Occasionally, they will concentrate and release a blast of psychic energy\u2014if they are hostile or under the effects of conflict, and can either see you or sense you via telepathy, it will \"lock on\" to your mind or telepathy for d15 damage (which is halved with half spell damage). If they are peaceful and not under the effects of conflict, it will \"feel quite soothing\" and no harm will be done.\nEating a mind flayer corpse grants you either telepathy or 1 intelligence point, with a 50% chance of each.\nIn addition to random generation, the master mind flayer is a candidate for the summon nasties monster spell.\nMind flayers are notorious for generating upon entering some floors of the Gnomish Mines, where they are normally far too high difficulty to appear. This is because the Mines levels specify that one random monster should be generated at normal level creation; this is almost always a dwarf, hobbit, or bugbear. On occasion, however, the function that chooses which monster should be generated totally ignores the difficulty of the monster it produces; flayers that generate like this are sometimes called minesflayers.\nMind flayers and master mind flayers are considered a consistent, high-level threat throughout the entirety of the game. Brainlessness is an instadeath that ignores not only your current HP, but lifesaving as well\u2014you will be brought back, only to immediately die again since your brain is still gone. If you die from intelligence drain while polymorphed, you will permanently die instead of reverting to your normal form.\nPolymorphing into a headless monster will protect you from the special attacks, mitigating the worst of their threat and leaving the matter of reducing the damage from each 'flay', along with the psychic blasts. Being polymorphed into a normally mindless form won't protect you; a comment in the relevant code says this is because players aren't mindless.\nIf you are outside of Gehennom and start sensing waves of psychic energy, that is your cue to farlook and check whether any you see is a dwarf\u2014a common YASD is to mistake the mind flayer for an easy kill, then march in and have your brain promptly eaten, especially if you are burdened and/or have low intelligence. Keep in mind that you will not see the psychic wave message every turn.\nWhen fighting mind flayers, avoid melee if at all possible and remain at a distance. Their high monster magic resistance will often stop all but the most powerful spells (e.g. finger of death), and cancellation will not affect their brainsucking attacks even if it successfully hits; this leaves projectiles such as daggers or arrows as your best bet to deal damage. Alternately, if your ranged attack options are limited and melee is your only out, consider stoning them or taking other measures to prevent or minimize stat loss (discussed further below); beware the master mind flayer's base AC of 0!\nMind flayers respect Elbereth if encountered outside of Gehennom, and can be deterred by standing on a scroll of scare monster; however, this does not prevent them locking on to your mind or telepathy. You can also scare them using methods such as an expensive camera or tooled horn\u2014 while not as secure as Elbereth and possibly subject to their high monster MR, these methods can also scare away other monsters that would not respect Elbereth. Beware that a fleeing mind flayer may still attack you, although it is much less likely to; additionally, a blinded one will not respect Elbereth.\nWearing any greased helm prevents the mind flayer's tentacles from reaching your brain, but the grease has a chance to wear off with each attack; a non-greased helm has a chance of preventing each of the mind flayer's tentacle attacks. Mind flayers get multiple attacks per turn, so you should not rely solely on a greased helm, especially if you are unable to kill them quickly. \nYou may alternately want to wear a dunce cap or ring of sustain ability; both items will fix your intelligence stat (either at 6 or its current value), preventing stat loss and thus brainlessness, on top of the dunce cap's chance to block the tentacles. However, none of these methods will prevent amnesia from a successful brainsucking, and you're likely to come out of the fight very forgetful\u2014have a means of re-identifying items on hand if possible. You can use #name to label one of a particular type of item(s) that you consider vital and/or does not auto-identify as a precaution; having an ideally blessed unicorn horn can also reverse the stat loss fairly quickly.\nThe amnesia and instadeath from brain-eating are enough to make both forms of mind flayer a popular target for blessed genocide\u2014but do not do this if you are a dwarf! Using a blessed scroll of genocide will remove all from the current game - dwarves included - and serves as a particularly aggravating YASD for forgetful dwarven players; those unable to use blessed genocide for this reason should instead use two different uncursed scrolls of genocide. If doing this, or else genociding from a throne, the master mind flayer should ideally be targeted first; regular mind flayers cannot be generated via summon nasties unless they randomly replace an extinct/genocided nasty.\n\"Do not use scrolls of genocide with unidentified beatitude\" - that one scroll you just found and read without checking may be cursed, and the summoned horde of mind flayers will often result in a quick death; even if you can scare them away, their psychic blasts may still overwhelm you. Also, be sure to mind your spelling, \"especially\" if you are a monk - misspelling it as \"master mindfalyer\" will only parse the word \"Master\", one of the Monk's rank titles, and wipe out all monks.\nWhile highly desirable as pets, taming a mind flayer is extremely hard and dangerous due to their monster magic resistance; you may be much better off using a polymorph trap on your current pet. Tame mind flayers make quick work of shopkeepers, and their telepathic outreach only locks onto hostile monsters, otherwise printing a harmless message (which can be hidden with MSGTYPE). However, remember that \"only\" peaceful mind flayers will produces soothing waves - if you see different messages related to psychic waves and are taking damage from them, a hostile mind flayer may be on the level.\nBe \"especially\" careful if your tame mind flayer becomes confused\u2014they will turn those psychic waves on you! The same danger is present if you have a means to instigate conflict; however, with their high monster magic resistance, once a mind flayer reaches level 15 it will become immune (and no longer a threat to you or your brain matter) during conflict.\nJellies are a serious threat to mind flayers, whose multiple tentacle attacks can and likely will trigger several passive attacks that can run up enough damage to easily kill them. Shapeshifters and green slimes are similarly dangerous: the former may go down quickly, but will polymorph the mind flayer when its corpse is eaten, while the latter is extremely likely to turn it into another slime. Ochre jellies are a common sight in the late game, especially as a summonable nasty\u2014consider giving your mind flayer any yellow dragon scales (or dragon scale mail) that you happen upon to provide them with valuable acid resistance.\nMind flayers also have a tendency to attract covetous monsters with their psychic blasts. If you are approaching, for example, the Wizard of Yendor's Tower, and you do not wish to leave them on another floor temporarily, be prepared to deal with your prematurely awakened foes and the host of problems that may follow.\nThe master mind flayer is a very sought-after polyform: on top of flight, multiple attacks per turn, a base AC of 0 and no changes to armor or encumbrance, its brain-eating attack is deadly to nearly anything. Non-mindless monsters take an additional d10 points of damage per brainsucking attack to simulate brain loss; additionally, you will gain d30 nutrition per suck message without risk of choking, and if your intelligence score is below the maximum (i.e. your own brain was sucked), it will be increased by d4. The intelligence increase is subject to the normal polymorphed attributes rules, and will be reset when you revert to your normal form; your max HP may also drop significantly in this form, especially if polymorphing at a high level.\nNaturally, players in mind flayer form face the same dangers as pet mind flayers, including potential death from triggering too many passive attacks. Furthermore, brainsucking a green slime causes delayed sliming, and eating a cockatrice's brain causes both immediate stoning and delayed stoning if the immediate stoning was life-saved. Sucking the brains of your race or other mind flayers will count as cannibalism as well; for Monks and vegan or vegetarians players, eating brains will also break those conducts. While you cannot choke directly from eating brains, you will not receive a warning when oversatiated, and thus run a significant risk of choking from eating \"anything\" afterward.\nIn NetHack 3.4.3 and previous versions, the game would not recognize the alternate spelling \"mindflayer\" when selecting a monster for genocide. A Monk that attempted to genocide \"master mindflayer\" would instead genocide \"master\", thus wiping out all Monks and ending the game. This is because \"master\" is one of the rank titles for Monks, and \"NetHack\" ignores the extra word \"mindflayer\". Both NetHack 3.6.0 and SLASH'EM recognize the \"mindflayer\" spelling, so it is okay to genocide \"master mindflayer\" in those games, but a typo like \"master mindfalyer\" can still wipe out all Monks and end the game.\nMind flayers are slightly different in SLASH'EM. First, the master mind flayer has three brain-eating attacks, while the normal mind flayer has five\u2014an unusual reverse of the situation in vanilla \"NetHack\". More importantly, though, the ring of free action provides luck-based protection against their brain-eating attacks, starting at a 50% of blocking each individual flay and increasing to a 90% chance at maxed-out luck. This, in combination with a greased helm, renders them much less of a threat.\nAlso, SLASH'EM introduces more sources of amnesia (such as potions of amnesia and migo queen attacks), making a preventative genocide of mind flayers much less of a surefire protection against amnesia.\nLastly, if you polymorph into an intelligent monster in SLASH'EM, generally you need not worry about petrifying monsters. This is true of mind flayers\u2014instead of eating the cockatrice's brain and being stoned, you will instead simply not use your tentacle attack against it at all. Your weapon attack will still go forward, though, and it is still possible to get stoned by other methods (e.g. attacking it bare-handed).\nMind flayers first appear in \"Dungeons & Dragons\" as Illithids; \"D&D\"&apos;s creator, Gary Gygax, was reportedly inspired to create the monster after seeing cover art for a book by Brian Lumley.\n",

If they are peaceful and not under the effects of conflict, it will \"feel quite soothing\" and no harm will be done.\nEating a mind flayer corpse grants you either telepathy or 1 intelligence point, with a 50% chance of each.\nIn addition to random generation, the master mind flayer is a candidate for the summon nasties monster spell.\nMind flayers are notorious for generating upon entering some floors of the Gnomish Mines, where they are normally far too high difficulty to appear. This is because the Mines levels specify that one random monster should be generated at normal level creation; this is almost always a dwarf, hobbit, or bugbear. On occasion, however, the function that chooses which monster should be generated totally ignores the difficulty of the monster it produces; flayers that generate like this are sometimes called minesflayers.\nMind flayers and master mind flayers are considered a consistent, high-level threat throughout the entirety of the game. Brainlessness is an instadeath that ignores not only your current HP, but lifesaving as well\u2014you will be brought back, only to immediately die again since your brain is still gone. If you die from intelligence drain while polymorphed, you will permanently die instead of reverting to your normal form.\nPolymorphing into a headless monster will protect you from the special attacks, mitigating the worst of their threat and leaving the matter of reducing the damage from each 'flay', along with the psychic blasts. Being polymorphed into a normally mindless form won't protect you; a comment in the relevant code says this is because players aren't mindless.\nIf you are outside of Gehennom and start sensing waves of psychic energy, that is your cue to farlook and check whether any you see is a dwarf\u2014a common YASD is to mistake the mind flayer for an easy kill, then march in and have your brain promptly eaten, especially if you are burdened and/or have low intelligence. Keep in mind that you will not see the psychic wave message every turn.\nWhen fighting mind flayers, avoid melee if at all possible and remain at a distance. Their high monster magic resistance will often stop all but the most powerful spells (e.g. finger of death), and cancellation will not affect their brainsucking attacks even if it successfully hits; this leaves projectiles such as daggers or arrows as your best bet to deal damage. Alternately, if your ranged attack options are limited and melee is your only out, consider stoning them or taking other measures to prevent or minimize stat loss (discussed further below); beware the master mind flayer's base AC of 0!\nMind flayers respect Elbereth if encountered outside of Gehennom, and can be deterred by standing on a scroll of scare monster; however, this does not prevent them locking on to your mind or telepathy. You can also scare them using methods such as an expensive camera or tooled horn\u2014 while not as secure as Elbereth and possibly subject to their high monster MR, these methods can also scare away other monsters that would not respect Elbereth. Beware that a fleeing mind flayer may still attack you, although it is much less likely to; additionally, a blinded one will not respect Elbereth.\nWearing any greased helm prevents the mind flayer's tentacles from reaching your brain, but the grease has a chance to wear off with each attack; a non-greased helm has a chance of preventing each of the mind flayer's tentacle attacks. Mind flayers get multiple attacks per turn, so you should not rely solely on a greased helm, especially if you are unable to kill them quickly. \nYou may alternately want to wear a dunce cap or ring of sustain ability; both items will fix your intelligence stat (either at 6 or its current value), preventing stat loss and thus brainlessness, on top of the dunce cap's chance to block the tentacles. However, none of these methods will prevent amnesia from a successful brainsucking, and you're likely to come out of the fight very forgetful\u2014have a means of re-identifying items on hand if possible. You can use #name to label one of a particular type of item(s) that you consider vital and/or does not auto-identify as a precaution; having an ideally blessed unicorn horn can also reverse the stat loss fairly quickly.\nThe amnesia and instadeath from brain-eating are enough to make both forms of mind flayer a popular target for blessed genocide\u2014but do not do this if you are a dwarf! Using a blessed scroll of genocide will remove all from the current game - dwarves included - and serves as a particularly aggravating YASD for forgetful dwarven players; those unable to use blessed genocide for this reason should instead use two different uncursed scrolls of genocide. If doing this, or else genociding from a throne, the master mind flayer should ideally be targeted first; regular mind flayers cannot be generated via summon nasties unless they randomly replace an extinct/genocided nasty.\n\"Do not use scrolls of genocide with unidentified beatitude\" - that one scroll you just found and read without checking may be cursed, and the summoned horde of mind flayers will often result in a quick death; even if you can scare them away, their psychic blasts may still overwhelm you. Also, be sure to mind your spelling, \"especially\" if you are a monk - misspelling it as \"master mindfalyer\" will only parse the word \"Master\", one of the Monk's rank titles, and wipe out all monks.\nWhile highly desirable as pets, taming a mind flayer is extremely hard and dangerous due to their monster magic resistance; you may be much better off using a polymorph trap on your current pet. Tame mind flayers make quick work of shopkeepers, and their telepathic outreach only locks onto hostile monsters, otherwise printing a harmless message (which can be hidden with MSGTYPE). However, remember that \"only\" peaceful mind flayers will produces soothing waves - if you see different messages related to psychic waves and are taking damage from them, a hostile mind flayer may be on the level.\nBe \"especially\" careful if your tame mind flayer becomes confused\u2014they will turn those psychic waves on you! The same danger is present if you have a means to instigate conflict; however, with their high monster magic resistance, once a mind flayer reaches level 15 it will become immune (and no longer a threat to you or your brain matter) during conflict.\nJellies are a serious threat to mind flayers, whose multiple tentacle attacks can and likely will trigger several passive attacks that can run up enough damage to easily kill them. Shapeshifters and green slimes are similarly dangerous: the former may go down quickly, but will polymorph the mind flayer when its corpse is eaten, while the latter is extremely likely to turn it into another slime. Ochre jellies are a common sight in the late game, especially as a summonable nasty\u2014consider giving your mind flayer any yellow dragon scales (or dragon scale mail) that you happen upon to provide them with valuable acid resistance.\nMind flayers also have a tendency to attract covetous monsters with their psychic blasts. If you are approaching, for example, the Wizard of Yendor's Tower, and you do not wish to leave them on another floor temporarily, be prepared to deal with your prematurely awakened foes and the host of problems that may follow.\nThe master mind flayer is a very sought-after polyform: on top of flight, multiple attacks per turn, a base AC of 0 and no changes to armor or encumbrance, its brain-eating attack is deadly to nearly anything. Non-mindless monsters take an additional d10 points of damage per brainsucking attack to simulate brain loss; additionally, you will gain d30 nutrition per suck message without risk of choking, and if your intelligence score is below the maximum (i.e. your own brain was sucked), it will be increased by d4. The intelligence increase is subject to the normal polymorphed attributes rules, and will be reset when you revert to your normal form; your max HP may also drop significantly in this form, especially if polymorphing at a high level.\nNaturally, players in mind flayer form face the same dangers as pet mind flayers, including potential death from triggering too many passive attacks. Furthermore, brainsucking a green slime causes delayed sliming, and eating a cockatrice's brain causes both immediate stoning and delayed stoning if the immediate stoning was life-saved. Sucking the brains of your race or other mind flayers will count as cannibalism as well; for Monks and vegan or vegetarians players, eating brains will also break those conducts. While you cannot choke directly from eating brains, you will not receive a warning when oversatiated, and thus run a significant risk of choking from eating \"anything\" afterward.\nIn NetHack 3.4.3 and previous versions, the game would not recognize the alternate spelling \"mindflayer\" when selecting a monster for genocide. A Monk that attempted to genocide \"master mindflayer\" would instead genocide \"master\", thus wiping out all Monks and ending the game. This is because \"master\" is one of the rank titles for Monks, and \"NetHack\" ignores the extra word \"mindflayer\". Both NetHack 3.6.0 and SLASH'EM recognize the \"mindflayer\" spelling, so it is okay to genocide \"master mindflayer\" in those games, but a typo like \"master mindfalyer\" can still wipe out all Monks and end the game.\nMind flayers are slightly different in SLASH'EM. First, the master mind flayer has three brain-eating attacks, while the normal mind flayer has five\u2014an unusual reverse of the situation in vanilla \"NetHack\". More importantly, though, the ring of free action provides luck-based protection against their brain-eating attacks, starting at a 50% of blocking each individual flay and increasing to a 90% chance at maxed-out luck. This, in combination with a greased helm, renders them much less of a threat.\nAlso, SLASH'EM introduces more sources of amnesia (such as potions of amnesia and migo queen attacks), making a preventative genocide of mind flayers much less of a surefire protection against amnesia.\nLastly, if you polymorph into an intelligent monster in SLASH'EM, generally you need not worry about petrifying monsters. This is true of mind flayers\u2014instead of eating the cockatrice's brain and being stoned, you will instead simply not use your tentacle attack against it at all. Your weapon attack will still go forward, though, and it is still possible to get stoned by other methods (e.g. attacking it bare-handed).\nMind flayers first appear in \"Dungeons & Dragons\" as Illithids; \"D&D\"&apos;s creator, Gary Gygax, was reportedly inspired to create the monster after seeing cover art for a book by Brian Lumley.\n",
    "samurai": "Samurai\nSamurai are Japanese warriors who adhere to the discipline of (honor) and fight their enemies using ancient martial arts. Therefore they start out lawful and human, but can be of either gender. Their first sacrifice gift is Snickersnee.\nThe Samurai is one of the strongest roles in the early game, and thus an excellent choice for a new player. The guidebook describes them like this:\nEach samurai starts with the following:\nBULLET::::- a +0 katana (samurai sword)\nBULLET::::- a +0 wakizashi (short sword)\nBULLET::::- a +0 yumi (bow)\nBULLET::::- 26 to 45 ya (bamboo arrows)\nBULLET::::- a +0 rustproof splint mail\nBULLET::::- a blindfold (20% chance)\nInstead of a random pet, a samurai always starts with a little dog called Hachi, in reference to \"\".\nHachiko was a famous Japanese dog who faithfully waited for the return of his dead owner for nine years until his own death. \"Hachi\" means eight, in reference of its birth order in the litter and \"ko\" implies affection.\nSamurai gain intrinsics at these experience levels:\nBULLET::::- Level 1: speed\nBULLET::::- Level 15: stealth\nSamurai start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Long sword\", \"Short sword\", \"Bow\", and \"Martial arts\"\nSince the samurai are Japanese, some of the game items use Japanese names in place of their regular English names when playing as a Samurai. The following is a list of those items with their Japanese names:\n! English !! Japanese\nThere are also some regular items that are uniquely Japanese. Once identified, these are described using their Japanese name, regardless of which role you are playing. These items are the following:\nBULLET::::- ya (\"bamboo arrow\")\nBULLET::::- yumi (\"long bow\")\nBULLET::::- katana (\"samurai sword\")\nBULLET::::- tsurugi (\"long samurai sword\")\nBULLET::::- shuriken (\"throwing star\")\nAdditionally some pieces of dialog are also changed. On losing a level or dying, you receive the message \"Sayonara\", instead of the usual \"Goodbye\"; when starting or loading a game, it greets you with \"Konichi wa\"; and friendly shopkeepers and priests greet you with \"Irasshaimase\".\nThe bushido code requires that samurai behave honorably. Dishonorable acts will incur an alignment penalty and display a guilt message. Examples include:\nBULLET::::- Digging up a grave: \u22121 \"You disturb the honorable dead!\"\nBULLET::::- Attacking a peaceful or tame creature: \u22121 \"You dishonorably attack the innocent!\"\nBULLET::::- Attacking with a poisoned weapon: \u22121 \"You dishonorably use a poisoned weapon!\"\nA Samurai with a non-Lawful alignment (probably from wearing a helm of opposite alignment) will still receive the message, but will not suffer the alignment penalty.\nAs far as weapons go, the samurai should not bother with any sword other than a long sword. The katana they start with is the finest one-handed non-artifact weapon in the game. Since the samurai can reach expert level in two-weapon combat they are better off swinging two long swords/katana than one of any larger non-artifact weapon. However, in the early game it is important to build up skill in individual weapons, which cannot be done while using two weapons.\nOf course, the samurai becomes even more powerful \"with\" an artifact weapon. Early options include Snickersnee, a buffed-up katana that you can get by sacrificing to your God, or Excalibur, an artifact weapon that has a chance of being created if you dip a long sword into a fountain. Do this after you have attained experience level 5, but preferably 7. Note that you must use an actual long sword to accomplish this, do \"not\" dip your starting katana into a fountain to try to accomplish this. Once you have a decent artifact weapon and expert skill in long sword, slide your original katana over to the secondary hand in two-weapon combat, and it will continue to add its damage to your attacks.\nDon't use the wakizashi for two-weapon combat because it's a short sword; a type of sword inferior to all other swords in inflicting damage. Find a long sword, which will share the skills you gained with the katana. A crysknife is good, but might not be worth the effort it takes to make one. Advancing multiple other weapon skills beyond basic level should be avoided, due to the finite number of skill slots available to you. If you don't care about riding or spells, however, it is not an issue. Save slots for two-weaponing, longsword, possibly saber, and bow or shuriken.\nThe yumi is a good long distance ranged weapon, especially since it can shoot 2 ya in a single turn. It will aid you in situations where melee combat may prove fatal\u2014fighting floating eyes and cockatrices for example. However, veteran players recommend that the bow skill should only be advanced to skilled level, not expert level. This is so you can save expert level slots for later.\nThe samurai strategy is very simple. If it moves, stab it, and if it's sessile, stab it anyway. Samurai are also good ranged warriors, receiving a bonus to hit and damage when shooting ya from a yumi. Samurai aren't good at spell casting. However, the katana and splint mail they start with make the first few levels a breeze.\nThe Samurai quest item is the Tsurugi of Muramasa, a powerful two-handed tsurugi with the ability to bisect enemies (i. e. kill them outright) 5% of the time, much like the Vorpal Blade. Therefore it is not a good idea to engage your quest nemesis in honourable melee combat, since he might bisect you; making things worse, he ignores Elbereth. It's better to zap him with a wand of death. If you don't have one, other techniques include zapping him with a wand of sleep or hurling a potion of paralysis at him before attacking so that he can't fight back, protecting yourself with a scroll of earth on the upstair and killing him with ranged attacks, polymorphing into a black dragon and disintegrating him, and so forth. If you have a strong melee attack, you could just wear an amulet of life saving and hope for the best, possibly retreating if you have to burn the amulet; actually, having an amulet of life saving is probably a good idea anyway no matter what strategy you choose, just in case you get unlucky.\nThe quest is notable for producing a lot of loot, especially attack wands, which your opponents will use against you. Reflection, or at least resistance to sleep, fire, and cold, are highly desirable.\nWith maxed strength and enchantment, shuriken and ya deal roughly comparable damage (since ya do not benefit from your strength bonus). Ya are slightly more effective when poisoned and/or benefiting from bonus damage, thanks to the Samurai's +1 multishot bonus when using them. Shuriken, on the other hand, do not require a wielded launcher (potentially saving valuable turns), and are generally more plentiful thanks to the Quest.\nThe Tsurugi is an excellent weapon in the mid-game (i. e. from the Quest to Gehennom), but becomes weaker in the end-game because it doesn't deal double damage like some other artifact weapons. (Frost Brand, Fire Brand, Grayswandir and the Staff of Aesculapius.) Once you have enough scrolls to enchant your primary weapon up to +7, you'll want to make the Tsurugi your back up. But until then, happy bisecting!\nIn the long term, the most damaging artifact weapon for the Samurai is the Frost Brand. The most damaging all-purpose melee attack in the game comes from a samurai double wielding a +7 Frost Brand and a +7 katana. This assumes 18/** STR and expert level in both two-weapon combat and long sword. Next comes the Fire Brand, then Grayswandir, and then the Tsurugi of Muramasa.\nIf you have some wishes to burn, consider the Sceptre of Might, the Magic Mirror of Merlin or the Orb of Detection for magic resistance. In the non-artifact category, gray or silver dragon scale mail is a must-have, as is a good pair of fireproof speed boots.\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1-2: Hatamoto\nBULLET::::- XL 3-5: Ronin\nBULLET::::- XL 6-9: Ninja/Kunoichi\nBULLET::::- XL 10-13: Joshu\nBULLET::::- XL 14-17: Ryoshu\nBULLET::::- XL 18-21: Kokushu\nBULLET::::- XL 22-25: Daimyo\nBULLET::::- XL 26-29: Kuge\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Shogun\nThe Samurai quest sees you fight Ashikaga Takauji for the Tsurugi of Muramasa.\nIn several variants, including Slash'EM Extended, SlashTHEM, and NetHack--, these additional items have Japanese names:\n! Japanese !! English\nSamurai can be played more or less the same way in SLASH'EM as in Vanilla. Just be a little more wary of enemies' stronger attack power, using your ya and scribbling the E word whenever enemies are near.\nBULLET::::- Their \"kiii\" technique gives a temporary boost to your attack power. Due to the Samurai's strong attack power you may never use it, but it can be useful if you're facing somewhat powerful enemies and want to take them out quickly.\nBULLET::::- SLASH'EM allows you to #twoweapon two artifacts at the same time. Considering that Samurai can easily get both Excalibur and Snickersnee\u2014two of the most powerful weapons in the game\u2014and are able to advance both longsword and #twoweapon to expert, this is a huge advantage.\nBULLET::::- Since a Samurai wielding both Excalibur and Snickersnee will do large amounts of damage even with zero enchantment, enchanting your weapons is a low priority. If you find any scrolls of enchant weapon, consider blessing it and enchanting your unicorn horn\u2014enchanting unicorn horns increases their chances of working in SLASH'EM.\nBULLET::::- Once you have at least a submachine gun and a bunch of bullets, don't bother any more with the yumi. Firearms are superior to bows and arrows. Later, replace your submachine gun with an assault rifle. The assault rifle will be very good for the special cases where melee is a bad idea.\nBULLET::::- Save up gold for shops, or get good at stealing: along with rogues and barbarians, samurai are massively overcharged in shops, paying twice as much. This is mainly relevant when you find a magic lamp in a shop, which in SLASH'EM has a base price of 1000zm.\nBULLET::::- A good ascension kit for a Samurai is:\nBULLET::::- +7 Excalibur two-weaponed with +7 Snickersnee or other powerful artifact weapon\nBULLET::::- an amulet of life saving or amulet of flying\nBULLET::::- +5 silver dragon scale mail\nBULLET::::- +7 cloak of magic resistance (enchant an elven cloak to +7 and upgrade it)\nBULLET::::- +5 gauntlets of power or gauntlets of dexterity\nBULLET::::- +5 fireproof speed boots for the extra attacks, jumping boots for the extra movement, water walking boots to be safe from create pool, or +7 elven boots for the extra AC and stealth\nBULLET::::- +5 shirt\nBULLET::::- greased +5 helm of telepathy or +7 elven leather helm\nBULLET::::- A +7 assault rifle and bullets\nBULLET::::- All the other standard ascension kit items that all roles need (bag, rings, potions, wands, tools, etc.)\nIn SlashTHEM, the samurai is quite similar to the slashem samurai with some differences.\nHe can be of any alignment. As a first sacrifice gift he gets Kiku-ichimonji, a better katana than Snickersnee, that is not a samurai affiliated sword any more. If lawful, Excalibur is a good and easy to get primary weapon for the drain resistance.\nThe quest is basically the same. The most notable difference is that the second level is filled with sea monsters, a lot of them capable of stealing. Be prepared with telepathy and plenty of ranged attacks.\nSome monsters have a passive disintegration attack, that can disintegrate your swords. So watch out for them.\nThe assault rifle is a very good ranged weapon. Especially with the higher weight cap, you can carry around thousands of bullets with out been burdened. A good ranged weapon is more important here, because of all the nasty attacks some monsters can posses.\nMagic is once more, more accesible, because dragon scales don't block magic any more.\ndNethack expands the list of items with Japanese names. This list is presented alphabetized by Japanese name for easy lookup.\n! Japanese !! English\nSamurai now get an artifact yumi as a crowning gift, Yoichi no yumi. It grants +1d20 to hit, 2x damage to fired ya, and can be #invoked to create ya. \nIn addition, the guaranteed first sacrifice gift for a samurai is now Kiku-ichimonji. It's a lawful samurai-favoring katana that grants +1d4 to hit and 1d12 to damage.\nSnickersnee is relegated to a nameable artifact, which can be named at xplvl 18 by tourists and 30 by samurai. It's now an intelligent knife, and has +1d3 to hit and +1d6 to damage, and a chance of beheading targets.\nLastly, the The Kusanagi no Tsurugi can be named at level 18, but only used as a weapon at 30. It's an intelligent long sword with +1d20 to hit and +1d12 to damage. In addition, it may behead targets and will instantly kill elementals. It grants energy regeneration while wielded, and searching and luck while carried.\n",
    "croesus": "Croesus\nCroesus, , is a notable monster in \"NetHack\". He is the rich owner of Fort Ludios and all the vaults seen in the dungeon, and has many guards and Yendorian Army soldiers on his payroll.\nIf you encounter a guard while inside one of the vaults, you can enter Croesus in the prompt when the guard asks for your name, and you will be left alone until the next one checks in. The name can also be spelled Kroisos or Creosote; the latter is the name of a similarly wealthy \"Discworld\" character that plays on the name Croesus. For lawful player characters, doing this incurs a -1 alignment penalty for lying \"unless\" it is also their actual name. Attempting this after killing the real Croesus will instead anger the guard. (\"Back from the dead, are you? I'll remedy that!\")\nCroesus resides in a throne room on the right half of Fort Ludios, occupying the throne himself; he will always start with a two-handed sword. \nCharacters that are ready for the Castle should be able to deal with him, with some caution; while Croesus has only one weapon attack, it hits for 4d10 damage, which can wipe out under-leveled or poorly armored characters in a few swings. Dispatching him at a distance is a good idea for mid-level characters, especially since he has no resistances; a wand of sleep will render him much easier to dispose of, although he does have some magic resistance and a decently low natural AC of 0.\nBecause Croesus cannot swim, you can freely shoot wands and projectiles at him from from across Fort Ludios' moat and chip him down, since he can only retaliate if he spawns with his own attack wand or else picks one up (usually from another monster killed by the ranged assault); he poses no more danger in this regard than the multiple soldiers you likely fought in order to reach that area. A ring of conflict can easily turn Croesus and the other throne room denizens against each other, and eventually one of them will kill him; at worst, he will be weakened enough that you can mop him and the other survivors up at your leisure.\nIf you use a boulder (e.g. from a scroll of earth or any giants on the level) or source of cold (e.g. wand of cold or a frost horn), you can cross the moat and take the fight to Croesus, though you must also contend with the throne room monsters; remember that he can see invisible, and like all humans he does not respect Elbereth. Alternately, you can wait for him to step onto the newly created ice, then use a fire-based attack (e.g. wand of fire) to melt it and drown him. Even a low-level character can defeat Croesus this way; however, he is faster than an unencumbered player character at base speed, and has a chance to get two actions in a row (1 in every 4 turns on average) and cross the moat before you have an opportunity to melt the ice.\nIn xNetHack and EvilHack, which use the object materials system, Croesus will always have gold armor and a gold two-handed sword.\n",
    "juiblex": "Juiblex\nJuiblex (often mistakenly referred to as Jubilex) is a demon lord whose lair is a swamp. Juiblex has infravision and can engulf players and render them ill, as well as spitting acid venom. \nIf he is not generated elsewhere in a game, e.g. via bones, Juiblex is guaranteed to appear at the center of his swamp. There is a 1/260 chance that a water demon may summon him or Yeenoghu, making it possible for him to appear quite early in the game and obliterate a weak character if they try fountain dipping or quaffing. He can also be summoned by same race sacrifice, and will be generated as peaceful if you are chaotic.\nLike other demon lords, Juiblex is covetous and will teleport to meet you. Because of his infravision, he can see you across his swamp, and will typically confront you a few turns after entering the level, as soon as he can get a turn. Dealing with him in a straight fight is tedious, despite his incredibly low speed; on top of his low AC of -7 and the usual troubles with covetous characters, his illness-inducing engulfing attack can and will kill you shortly unless you can cure it with a eucalyptus leaf or a unicorn horn. You will \"then\" have to escape his grasp before becoming ill again, which may give him time to teleport away or else re-engulf you.\nThus, the most common strategy uses a preferably blessed unicorn horn, a wand of digging, and a decent weapon of any kind: when he engulfs you, zapping the wand will tear through him and drop his HP to 1, like any non-whirly engulfing monster. Cure the illness as soon as possible, especially once you have successfully disposed of him; if you are having trouble hitting due to his naturally low AC of -7, you can allow him to re-engulf you for a guaranteed hit. If you do so, do not forget to cure your illness again.\nAs one of the demon lords who can be summoned, Juiblex can be made peaceful if a chaotic player sacrifices his own race on an aligned altar. If this occurs, it may be worth attacking him as soon as you are prepared for the relatively large XP reward, with comparatively minimal risk and only the three required items above.\nIf you allow Juiblex to engulf you, and then damage him a bit, he'll teleport to the up staircase with you inside of him. This allows easy traversal of his no-teleport swamp lair, especially when coming up from the Sanctum with the Amulet of Yendor. With regular curing of the illness and attention to your HP, it may be possible to continue the Juiblex Express up to dungeon level one.\nJuiblex presents a difficult problem for extinctionists. He cannot be stoned, so repeated stoning and unstoning will not work unlike most other unique monsters. He will never leave a corpse, so undead turning also fails.\nLife-saved re-kills do not count toward the kill counter, and even those take some effort. Extinctionists looking to add Juiblex to their list will have to drop an amulet of life saving into his belly while engulfed. Then, zap or cast slow monster or speed monster at him to make him put it on. He will not pick up an amulet by normal means, but can be generated with one.\nIn UnNetHack, zapping a wand of digging to escape Juiblex's engulfing will only reduce his HP to half its current value, instead of bringing it down to one.\nIn Slash'EM Extended, zapping a wand/spell of digging while engulfed by Juiblex will only reduce his HP by 20% of its current value.\nJuiblex is an original creation of Dungeons and Dragons. As the encyclopedia says, he is a slime-like being.\n",
    "demogorgon": "Demogorgon\nDemogorgon is the most difficult of the demon princes and perhaps the most difficult monster overall to appear in \"NetHack\". He is one of three not to have his own lair (the other two being Geryon and Dispater), and therefore is not guaranteed to appear. Demogorgon is covetous like all demon lords and princes, and possessess infravision and flight; he can cast spells, use a life-draining sting, and two disease-inducing claw attacks. As of NetHack 3.4.0, if the first claw attack hits, the second one will instead stun you upon a successful hit.\nDemogorgon's appearance is not guaranteed, as it can only occur through demon summoning. He can be summoned directly by Orcus, Juiblex, or Yeenoghu, and hence indirectly by any demon that can summon one of these demon lords; he may also be rarely generated by any spellcasting monster that casts \"summon nasties\" in Gehennom, which includes the Wizard of Yendor.\nThe safest approach to Demogorgon is not to meet him in the first place; in vanilla NetHack, Demogorgon will not appear unless summoned as mentioned above. Since Orcus, Juiblex and Yeenoghu are the most likely to do this, kill them as expeditiously as possible; if you get bogged down fighting lesser threats, you are giving Demogorgon an opportunity to arrive every turn.\nConversely, if you \"want\" to fight Demogorgon for bragging rights, you can take precautions against Orcus' wand of death and let him spend all the time he wants ineffectively zapping you with it; he will eventually summon Demogorgon. If Yeenoghu summons Demogorgon, you may have a hard time being neither confused nor stunned for a turn, leaving you open to further status afflictions - including Demo's dreaded disease attack - if you try to attack or else spend a turn trying to cure the afflictions.\nThe Demogorgon FAQ written by Kate Nepveu covers a lot of relevant strategies for understanding and dealing with Demogorgon; note that it is based on NetHack 3.4.0, and thus some of the information will be dated.\nThe only \"surefire\" way to survive Demogorgon is to be prepared. Just as you carry an escape item for emergencies, work out your \"Demogorgon Kit\" and carry it in your inventory when you enter Gehennom. It is preferable to be very fast and unencumbered, as Demogorgon can only be outsped by fast or very fast characters who are unburdened. The ability to cure diseases is critical, as is having a solid offense \"and\" a means of escape; a scroll of scare monster in a container is very helpful, especially since Demogorgon is liable to curse your items. Be aware that not even a blessed unicorn horn is perfectly reliable for curing sickness \u2014 the safest items are holy water, blessed potions of healing, extra healing, or full healing, or the spell at 0% failure rate.\nIf Demogorgon \"does\" appear and you did not plan on fighting him, it is usually best to leave the level immediately: teleport to the staircase, quaff a cursed potion of gain level, zap a wand of digging downwards, etc. As always, discretion is the better part of valor. Beware that Demogorgon will follow you to another level if standing next to you; you can gain the necessary distance by teleporting him, paralyzing him, being fast enough, damaging him so that he teleports, etc.\nIf this happens while you have the Amulet of Yendor, throwing it away is something of a last resort; Demogorgon will give you a turn or two by teleporting to it to pick it up, but you are committing to fighting him at some later point if you successfully escape. You can then use the breathing space to reassess, re-equip, and move back in on your own terms.\nMost strategies for tackling Demogorgon involve getting to the upstairs before he can; as he is covetous and will teleport to that tile to heal any damage, the usual strategies for stopping covetous monsters from escaping apply here. If you manage to encounter him outside of Gehennom, you can burn Elbereth to scare him off and prevent him from attacking; note that as of 3.6.1, you won't be able to attack him in return. You can also make use of a scroll of scare monster, which will let you attack him and will also work in Gehennom. You can additionally keep him at a distance using a non-cursed scroll of earth and a non-force bolt ranged attack; most spells are rendered impractical against him due to his extremely high monster magic resistance.\nIf you choose to engage him in melee, make sure you possess magic resistance, and that your weapon is blessed and well-enchanted in order to handle Demogorgon's base \u22128 AC and item-cursing spells; the more time you spend trying to finish him off, the more likely he is to curse something vital or else render you ill. Demogorgon's first disease attack leaves you with between 20 and (19 + constitution) turns to live, which is a fairly comfortable margin for healing yourself; however, each subsequent disease attack he lands will reduce your remaining turns to live by roughly two-thirds, although as of 3.4.0 you will instead be stunned if both disease attacks hit. There is no way to know the exact value of your turns-to-live counter if you are diseased, so you should act as if the worst case were true in every circumstance.\nDemogorgon is not immune to stoning or disintegration, so you can kill him via those methods; if you have any wishes left, a partly eaten chickatrice corpse may be worthwhile. A more reliable approach is to polymorph into a female cockatrice and lay some eggs ahead of time to use as petrification grenades.\nIf you are a Knight with expert skill in lance and you are riding, you may be able to joust Demogorgon to death before he gets a chance to teleport to the stairs; if you're lucky, you'll even be able to hit him before he sickens you. If he does get away, you can use a unicorn horn and try again.\nIn SLASH'EM, Demogorgon has his own lair somewhere between the second and sixth levels of Gehennom, like Juiblex, Yeenoghu and Orcus \u2013 so you are guaranteed to meet him. Note that Demogorgon's lair is a non-teleport level \u00ad\u2013 don't even try to use your wand of teleportation. Demogorgon still can teleport to the staircase, and to you, as covetous monsters usually do.\nKeep in mind that the behavior of unicorn horns is changed in SLASH'EM, making them far less reliable. However, enchantment now matters a lot. You should come prepared with a highly enchanted horn to deal with the sickening attack.\nSLASH'EM monks can however easily kill him using pummel technique.\nIn UnNetHack, Demogorgon does \"not\" respect Elbereth. He sometimes appears in his own lair in Gehennom, but this is not guaranteed; the lair takes the form of a small self-contained maze surrounded by a moat of ice.\nIn Slash'EM Extended, as in UnNetHack, Demogorgon does \"not\" respect Elbereth, and he is also immune to stoning, so the usual strategy of throwing a cockatrice egg won't work either. He will sometimes be waiting in his lair in Gehennom (but it's not guaranteed; Lamashtu's or another demon's lair may be generated instead). All chaotic major demons can randomly summon him on other dungeon levels, though.\nAs in the other variants, Demogorgon does not respect Elbereth, and has a guaranteed lair. This is found at the very bottom of Gehennom, typically only one or two levels before the vibrating square level.\nDemogorgon comes from Dungeons and Dragons. D&D in turn derived him from a supposed pagan god invented by Christian authors. In both sources, he is a powerful demon.\nAccording to D&D, Demogorgon is 5.5 meters (18 feet) tall and has a vaguely humanoid/reptilian body, with two mandrill heads, two long reptilian necks and two tentacles for arms.\nHis image graces the front cover of \"Monster Manual 2\" in D&D's 4th edition.\nBULLET::::- Orcus\nBULLET::::- Yeenoghu\nBULLET::::- Juiblex\n",
    "orcus": "Orcus\nOrcus, , is one of the demon princes, guaranteed to appear in Orcus Town in Gehennom.\nOrcus does physical damage and some spell damage, both of which you should be ready for. He also carries a wand of death, although for any character with magic resistance, the main problem this poses is how to relieve him of it without him wasting too many charges.\nAs a chaotic demon prince, Orcus can summon Demogorgon and Yeenoghu (who can also summon Demogorgon), and cannot be bribed. \nIt is desirable to get Orcus's wand of death with as many charges as possible, and to kill him before he can summon Demogorgon (perhaps along with Yeenoghu). Like any covetous monster, he warps to the upstairs to heal when damaged, which can allow him many turns to summon and to use up wand charges; ideally, you would not allow him to react to your attack at all. \nHe is not immune to stoning, so hitting him with a cockatrice corpse will instantly kill him. Another option is to use potions of paralysis (along with free action), and kill him before the paralysis effect ends. A mounted Knight can also easily joust Orcus with the lance repeatedly until dead; the stunning component of the joust prevents him from getting away.\nIf fighting him directly is your only option, you need to get onto an upstairs yourself so he can't escape. This is most easily done by using the downstairs in Orcus's room when Orcus is adjacent to you, especially since the upstairs in Orcus-town is far away. You might arrange to be in this situation by coming up these stairs, either by digging down when it becomes clear you are at Orcus-town, or because you are mapping Gehennom from the bottom.\nOrcus in this form comes from Dungeons and Dragons, a representation originally inspired by a Roman god of the underworld.\nHe physically appears as a fat humanoid with a goat's head and legs, the horns of a ram, bat wings and a poisonous reptilian tail.\n",
    "yeenoghu": "Yeenoghu\nYeenoghu, , is a monster in NetHack, and one of the demon lords.\nYeenoghu is generated with a flail. \nYeenoghu, together with Juiblex, is one of the two demon lords that can be summoned with own-race sacrifice. If the player is lawful or neutral when performing this type of sacrifice, the demon princes will be hostile when summoned; if the player is chaotic, they will be peaceful. There is also a chance that a water demon may gate in Yeenoghu or Juiblex. So it's possible for him to appear quite early in the game and obliterate a weak character.\nYeenoghu can deal out tremendous physical damage if you lack free action and MC3; his melee attacks can also gate in other major demons, and he can zap you with magic missiles as well, meaning he is immune to them and death rays on top of his high monster magic resistance. However, Yeenoghu he is not generally regarded a problem if you are prepared for him.\nLike other demon princes, Yeenoghu is covetous will teleport next to you to deliver melee attacks and fire magic missiles. When at low health, he will teleport to the upstair tile to regenerate, and will escape up them if approached too closely; the usual strategies for covetous monsters apply, including obstructing the upstair or else luring him to a floor with a blocked upstair. As he is able to summon Demogorgon directly, dispatching him quickly is advised.\nYeenoghu respects Elbereth; however, as of NetHack 3.6.1, Elbereth does not work in Gehennom, where Yeenoghu is most likely to be encountered. Keep this in mind in the event he is found outside Gehennom (e.g. via water demon or a non-Gehennom bones) and you have a character capable of surviving his onslaught. However, the chances of having such a character in this scenario is often several degrees lower, and you may be better off escaping and avoiding the floor entirely if somehow possible. Even if you can take the fight to him, remember that in 3.6.0 and later versions you cannot attack him while on an Elbereth, either; on top of this, Yeenoghu's confusing gaze will complicate your attempts to engrave, and his tendency to teleport after you at the first opportunity usually means little time to prepare beforehand unless you can lure him to a pre-engraved Elbereth elsewhere.\nYeenoghu first appears in NetHack 3.0.0.\nYeenoghu is the subject of one of the longest-running bugs in NetHack history. In NetHack 3.1.0, the Riders were introduced. The code that handles their special attacks comes right after that which handles Yeenoghu's confusion attack. Early versions had this code inserted carelessly; consequently, after Yeenoghu used his confusion attack, execution would proceed into the section that handles Death's touch:\nA comment at the end of Yeenoghu's section read:\n/* fall through to next case */\nand contemporary source-divers thought from this that the behavior was deliberate. Thus for many years the bug was never reported.\nPat Rankin of the DevTeam was made aware of this property in a rec.games.roguelike.nethack discussion, and called it \"a ludicrous bug\". The then-current version was NetHack 3.3.1. In NetHack 3.4.0, Yeenoghu's illicit deadly touch was taken away.\nUmber hulks were not affected, because their confusion attack is handled in a different part of the code.\nThese source excerpts might make clear the origin of the bug. Here is src/mhitu.c lines 999-1012 from NetHack 3.0.0, which was before the Riders existed:\nBULLET::::1. ifdef HARD /* a non-gaze AD_CONF exists only for one of the demons */\n case AD_CONF:\nBULLET::::1. endif\n /* fall through to next case */\nHere is a partial quote of src/mhitu.c lines 1214-1258 from NetHack 3.1.0, the first version to implement the Riders:\nThe Rider code was carelessly placed between the AD_CONF section, which handles Yeenoghu's confusion attack, and the default section, where it was supposed to finish. Thus execution improperly proceeded into Death's touch attack.\nThe bug was written up as bug C331-96 and was fixed in NetHack 3.4.0. Here is src/mhitu.c lines 1474-1486 from NetHack 3.4.3:\nThe \"dmg = 0;\" and \"break;\" lines duplicate the ones in the default section, and Yeenoghu is restored to his pre-3.1.0 behavior.\nIn UnNetHack, Yeenoghu no longer respects Elbereth.\nIn Slash'EM Extended, in honor of the \"ludicrous bug\", Yeenoghu gets the extra ability to zap the player with finger of death. Unlike the touch of death, however, reflection can save the player here.\nYeenoghu is drawn from \"Dungeons & Dragons\". He is the demon lord of gnolls, which resemble anthropomorphic hyenas. In that depiction, he wields a triple flail.\n",
    "asmodeus": "Asmodeus\nAsmodeus, , is the most powerful of the demon princes who is guaranteed to appear in Gehennom. He will generally be encountered in his lair, unless you have somehow managed to meet him before reaching that level. He is no trouble at all, provided you have decent AC and cold resistance.\nAlternatively, if you are not wielding Excalibur, you can pay Asmodeus instead of fighting him. He asks for a portion of your visible gold so it is best to hide most of it, for example in a container.\nAsmodeus is always generated with a wand of cold and a wand of fire, but never a random offensive item.\nAsmodeus will appear before you first and (if you aren't wielding Excalibur) demand that you pay him for safe passage. When you refuse, or if he fails to see where you are, he becomes angry. Like some quest nemeses and other named demons, he will teleport to the upstairs when he takes a few hits. The easiest way to defeat him is to lure him down one level and then stand on the upstairs. A less effective method is to drive him upstairs until you reach a level that allows you to teleport to the upstairs ahead of him. Note also that level teleportation can be used to lure him to a level that permits teleportation.\nAlternatively, you can use a cockatrice corpse or egg to turn him into a statue the first time he shows his face, then break the statue for his wands and scrolls.\nIt is imperative that you be able to keep Asmodeus in your line of sight as much as possible, for like the aforementioned quest nemeses and named demons, in a few short turns after teleporting away from you, he will restore himself to perfect health; he starts with 198 hit points.\nAsmodeus has a unique magical cold attack. When used in melee, this attack does 30d6 damage (31d6 if Asmodeus has increased his level to 50), for a maximum of 186 points of damage. This damage is reduced by half spell damage, and completely nullified by cold resistance. Magic resistance and reflection provide no protection against this melee attack. The cold melee attack cannot freeze potions in your inventory. In a normal game, most players will have acquired cold resistance by the time they meet Asmodeus; however, if you do not (for example, because of conducts), then Asmodeus becomes a fearsome opponent.\nAsmodeus can also use a ranged version of his cold attack (\"Asmodeus zaps you with a cone of cold\"). The ranged version only does 6d6 damage. The ranged version's damage is also reduced by half spell damage, and is nullified by cold resistance and by reflection. Unlike the melee version, the ranged version can destroy potions in your inventory; reflection prevents this destruction.\nSince Asmodeus wants the Amulet of Yendor as much as you do, you can exploit this behaviour. If you can lure him to the Moloch's Sanctum, he will teleport to the high priest, engage (and hopefully defeat) him/her, take the Amulet, and go back to attacking you, allowing you to obtain the Amulet without leaving the vicinity of the staircase.\nIn principle, you could wound him just enough to chase him up the stairs, and repeat on each level. This lets you avoid the mysterious force, but is generally not worth the effort; Asmodeus can be struck by the force too.\nAsmodeus comes from \"Dungeons and Dragons\" and ultimately from Christian demonology. In both sources, he is a very powerful demon.\nThe \"D&D\" Asmodeus is a handsome, red-eyed, dark-skinned and dark-haired humanoid bearing two small horns and clad in very expensive clothing. He is more than 4 meters (13 feet) tall.\nMost variants, including SLASH'EM, don't have an encyclopedia entry.\n is probably the second or third most powerful creature in dNetHack, and is certainly the most powerful creature that the character may be forced to confront. This being the case, it is best when exploring to check all the perimeter rooms for the true downstairs before checking the center room. He will always demand a bribe of at least 9000 gold, and up to 9999, no matter how much the player has visible.\n",
    "grid bug": "Grid bug\nGrid bugs are one of the weakest monsters. They usually deal no damage at all, unless they manage to zap you as well (\"You get zapped!\"), and even then the damage is very small. This electric attack does not break your rings and wands unless they are higher level than zero.\nGrid bugs are unique in that they cannot move or attack diagonally. When polymorphed to a grid bug, attempting to move diagonally will provide the message \"You can't get there from here...\"\nOne of the demonic maledictions specifically reference grid bugs. Some have proposed moving like a grid bug as an unofficial conduct.\nThey are nothing to worry about once you pass level 2.\nIf you need to train up a weapon skill, grid bugs can be useful as target practice. Or, you can let your pet kill them, to help it grow stronger.\nThe concept of grid bugs came from the 1982 Disney film, .\n",
    "rust monster": "Rust monster\nRust monsters are unable to cause direct damage, but their touch attack rusts your armor and their passive attack rusts your weapon; in this way, they are similar to brown puddings.\nAs rust monsters have a speed of 18, faster than most players, running away is usually not possible.\nThe best way to deal with them is to rustproof your equipment, effectively rendering their attacks completely harmless. If this is not an option, you can fight them from a distance while avoiding melee combat by using Elbereth or similar means. Alternatively, unequipping iron armor may help if no other dangerous monsters are around; consider their high speed when doing this to avoid them moving next to you before you are ready to fight them.\nAs non-metal weapon, unicorn horns can be useful to fight them.\nRust monsters are metallivores; however, unlike most metallivores, they will only eat rustprone metal. They will try to eat rustproof items, but \"spit them out in disgust\", removing the rustproofing. \nThey will eat a worn ball and chain (from punishment) and rust other monsters' iron items when attacking them. Because of this, they make semi-useful pets if you don't want any more iron items.\nAs player polymorphed into a rust monster, trying to eat a rustproof item will give the message \"Ulch - That  was rustproofed!\", then will stun you, followed by spitting the item onto the floor.\nBefore NetHack 3.1.0, rust (and other forms of object erosion) did not exist. Rust monsters and other things that caused rust instead reduced the enchantment; in the case of rust monsters this could go as low as -2. Thus rust monsters in older versions behaved more as modern disenchanters, save that their attack was still subject to an object's susceptibility to rust.\n",
    "lichen": "Lich\nA lich (not to be confused with a lichen) is a class of monster in NetHack represented by the overall symbol . Liches are all powerful spell-casters, and their more powerful forms have the ability to destroy armor, cast touch of death and most other spells, and teleport away when attacked; they are thus a frequent target of blessed genocide. All liches crumble to dust when killed and therefore do not leave corpses. The two most powerful kinds can be generated with athames, useful engraving weapons that are not normally generated.\nLich means \"corpse\" in several Germanic languages, and survives in English in the word \"lichgate\" (or \"lych-gate\", etc.), a covered entranceway to a churchyard. Nothing to do with \"leech\".\nLiches are powerful spellcasters, often magicians or kings, who seek to defy death by magical means. Are depicted as being clearly cadaverous, bodies desiccated or completely skeletal, with glowing lights in place of their eyes.\nThe lich, , is the least powerful monster of this class. It is slower than its brethren and not a significant threat. At the experience levels it is normally encountered, its complement of spells include healing itself, hasting itself, stunning you, turning invisible, draining your strength, destroying your armor, cursing your items and aggravating monsters (awakening monsters on the level and drawing them to you). It is possible for a lich to be generated with a high enough level (16) to cast summon nasties; however, this will not happen in the Castle unless you reach it at a much higher experience level than normal.\nIn addition to the spells the normal lich can cast, the demilich, , can often cast summon nasties; if you encounter one at the Castle, it is certain that it can cast this spell. It is possible for a demilich to be generated at a high enough level (21) to cast touch of death; however, this is almost impossible before reaching Gehennom.\nMaster liches and arch-liches (usually referred to as \"the purple L\") can teleport to the player, then to the upstairs to heal and back again, like a demon lord/prince. This form of teleportation is unaffected by no-teleport levels. While master liches at their base level cannot cast touch of death, if your experience level and/or dungeon level is high enough, they will be generated with the ability to cast that spell. Master liches are generated with a 7% chance of either an athame (86% chance) or a wand of nothing, but no random offensive items.\nThe arch-lich, , is the most powerful form of lich. In fact, it has the highest difficulty of all randomly generated monsters. Next to the Wizard of Yendor, it is one of the most powerful spell-casting monsters in the game. In addition to the spells its weaker brethren can cast, it is guaranteed to be able to cast touch of death, bringing instadeath to the unprepared.\nArch-liches have a 33% chance of getting either an athame (66%) or a non-negatively enchanted quarterstaff. There is a very small (1/260) chance the athame is Magicbane.\nIf you teleport, a pet arch-lich will teleport itself to your new location. They will pick up and wear armor, but not wield weapons. You do not need to feed it.\nSince liches are covetous (teleporting back and forth from the up stairs), the general strategy for dealing with covetous monsters applies here. If you have teleport control, you can teleport to the up stairs before it does. Engraving a permanent Elbereth on the up stairs will prevent them from retreating. (A non permanent engraving will always erode.)\nLiches can be prevented from teleporting by wielding a potion of paralysis, and hitting them with it while wearing a ring of free action. This should provide enough time to be able to dispose of them while they are paralyzed.\nThe best way to deal with a lich is to wield Magicbane to prevent the lich from cursing your inventory and make you resistant to the touch of death. Another way is to use Elbereth or a scroll of scare monster to prevent the lich from touching you. These strategies will still leave you potentially open to attacks from the nasties that the liches summon. However, summoning is not always bad. A strong character wielding Magicbane might allow liches to continuously summon nasties to kill for gear, exp, or a full-on extinction run.\nBecause the three lower lich types don't resist shock damage, Mjollnir is an excellent weapon to deal with them. If Mjollnir is not available, the Fire Brand will work on them as well. Arch-liches resist most elements, so there is no quick way to take them down, except by hitting them with a cockatrice or chickatrice corpse (don't forget to wear gloves), which will turn them to stone immediately. All liches can also be disintegrated by black dragon breath or digested by a purple worm.\nAll types of lich count as undead and are chaotic, so if you are also chaotic, they can be tamed by reading the blessed Book of the Dead. Master and arch-liches, however, are covetous monsters that wish to possess the Book of the Dead, and therefore can only be made peaceful, not tame. A tamed arch-lich can be made using the spell or by taming its lower brethren and then allowing them to grow up, but it's of little use as a tamed arch-lich can only cast self-beneficial spells, and therefore is rendered as a mediocre attacker that cannot even harm things immune to cold. Despite their covetous nature, they do not want the Amulet of Yendor. Therefore, they cannot be used to transport it across a non-teleport level.\nLiches can make acceptable pets, but have their disadvantages. They are essentially useless against cold resistant monsters and are dangerous to abandon. The stronger versions will also always stay next to the player, which is useful if you don't have a magic whistle but also can be a nuisance by them getting in the way, and makes it difficult to stop them from killing shopkeepers. Master liches and arch-liches cannot be tamed due to their covetous nature. It is, however, possible to tame a lich or demilich and have it grow up. You can also get one polymorphing another pet.\n",

    "wizard": "Wizard\nThe Wizard is one of the roles in \"NetHack\". Wizards can be either neutral or chaotic, and can be humans, elves, gnomes or orcs. Their first sacrifice gift is Magicbane. They are relatively poor fighters, but they are the best spellcasters in the game. The guidebook says of them:\nA wizard begins the game with:\nBULLET::::- a blessed +1 quarterstaff\nBULLET::::- a cloak of magic resistance\nBULLET::::- three random scrolls\nBULLET::::- a blessed spellbook of force bolt\nBULLET::::- a random non-force bolt spellbook of level 3 or lower\nBULLET::::- three random potions\nBULLET::::- two random rings\nBULLET::::- one random wand\nBULLET::::- if an elf, random non-magical musical instrument\nBULLET::::- 20% chance of magic marker\nBULLET::::- 20% chance of blindfold\nThe random items generated will never be any of the following:\nBULLET::::- scroll of amnesia\nBULLET::::- scroll of blank paper\nBULLET::::- scroll of fire\nBULLET::::- spellbook of blank paper\nBULLET::::- potion of acid\nBULLET::::- potion of hallucination\nBULLET::::- any ring with an enchantment of +0 or lower\nBULLET::::- ring of aggravate monster\nBULLET::::- ring of hunger\nBULLET::::- ring of levitation\nBULLET::::- ring of poison resistance if an orc\nBULLET::::- ring of polymorph control \"if\" you already have a wand, ring, or potion of polymorph\nBULLET::::- ring or potion of polymorph \"if\" you already have a ring of polymorph control\nBULLET::::- wand of nothing\nBULLET::::- wand of wishing\nBULLET::::- Exp level 8: teleport at will if the character has teleportitis\nBULLET::::- Exp level 15: warning\nBULLET::::- Exp level 17: teleport control\nWizards start always with \"Basic\" skill in quarterstaff, attack spells, and enchantment spells. This is independent of the category of the random spellbook, because the spellcasting skills are hardcoded in the function \"skill_init\" in weapon.c.\nWizards with an intelligence of 15 or 16 have reduced-hunger casting, and Wizards with an intelligence of 17 or above have hungerless casting.\nWizards have no bonus or penalty for emergency spells, but their special spell is , which is probably the most useful special spell among the spellcasting roles.\nWizards can write scrolls and spellbooks they don't know yet with much higher success rates than other roles. With maximized Luck, writing one is nearly a certainty.\nWizards get a warning when they have a high chance of failing to read a spellbook: \"This spellbook is [very] difficult to comprehend. Continue?\"\nCornuthaums give Wizards a charisma boost and clairvoyance, and only Wizards can enchant them to +7.\nWizards cannot fire multiple projectiles at once unless they are Expert at the relevant weapon skill.\nWizards spend less time as a beginner than other roles.\nIt takes 6 skill slots to reach Expert in daggers, and 20 slots to max out all the spellcasting skills. This means that a level 30 Wizard who chooses to enhance all spellcasting skills to maximum should have 3 slots free to spend on other skills, such as unrestricted artifact weapon skills.\nAs part of skill slot management, a Wizard should defer enhancing any spell skill until there comes a point when doing so would provide an in-game benefit. The benefits from enhancing a spell skill are that it lowers spell failure rates, and (depending on the spell) sometimes augments the effects of a spell. When advancing spell skills, it is a good idea to check which spells you have in each school, and make sure that at least one of your spells would benefit from being enhanced, before using up the skill slot.\nIt is important to note that a great many spells enjoy augmented effects when advancing from Basic to Skilled (notably, ), but only two spells enjoy augmented effects when going from Skilled to Expert (namely, ), and of these two, Wizards can only become Expert in jumping. Therefore, for spells other than escape spells, a Wizard gains no benefit from advancing to Expert unless there is a currently known high level spell (e.g. ) whose failure rate would be lowered by such advancement.\nIn particular, there is almost never any need to advance divination spells to Expert, since all divination spells have the same effects at Skilled as at Expert, and none of the divination spells are of very high spell level. The same goes for enchantment spells and healing spells (except for the useless ). The skill slots saved thereby are valuable to have available for weapons, especially early in the game.\nSome people advocate deliberately keeping your experience level low in the early game, but this is controversial. Increases in monster difficulty due to a higher experience levels are roughly balanced out with the benefits that come with the higher experience level, such as higher maximum power. The easiest way to prevent yourself from over-leveling is to allow your pet to kill as many monsters as is feasible, although one would be wise to still gain a few levels for the additional survivability and spell power capacity. These constraints are loosened when you learn magic missile, get Magicbane, or obtain some other offensive upgrade.\nUnless you are playing an atheist, if you manage to find an early coaligned altar, consider sacrificing at it until you get Magicbane, which will make your early game a lot easier.\nThe Mines are dangerous. Unless you are a gnome, all the normal inhabitants will want to kill you. It can be quite hard for inexperienced players to go straight to Minetown and survive long enough to return to the main dungeon. Exploring the deeper Mines past Minetown should perhaps be postponed, though you do eventually want to get there, as the Catacombs can be very profitable for a Wizard. \nCompleting Sokoban before doing anything else is likewise dangerous, because monsters difficulty increases with each completed puzzle, and your own experience level will probably not keep up with it.\nConsider going down to the Oracle level and breaking the centaur statues there in search of spare spellbooks, gaining a few levels in the process, then coming back up to do the Gnomish Mines.\nHunger may become an issue, especially if you do not start the game with Intelligence of 17 or above for hungerless casting. You may need to pray for food when weak, and the first floor of Sokoban with its guaranteed food might be a good place to go to stock up.\nEarly-game Wizards are very weak and should avoid engaging in melee combat with monsters. Finding a source of thrown weapons to damage or kill monsters before they can reach you is critical. \nMost Wizards pursue daggers as their sole weapon skill, because it is easy for them to get Magicbane (which uses dagger skill), and because throwing daggers at Expert skill later in the game does considerably more damage than using a quarterstaff. To that end, training daggers as soon as you come across some is a good idea. Easy ways to train daggers include throwing them at slow enemies, letting a fog cloud engulf you, or naming Sting and training it on goblins for the +d5 to-hit bonus. Descending briefly into the Gnomish Mines, where daggers are plentiful, is a good way to acquire some.\nStill, in the very early game, daggers may be hard to come by, so consider casting force bolt at a boulder or statue, picking up the resulting stones (as many as can be carried while staying unburdened), and quivering them. Throwing rocks at a monster is better than nothing, especially if you're out of power. Of course, you should replace them with darts, daggers, or other missiles as they become available.\nSome players advocate dumping the starting quarterstaff early on, either as soon as you find a non-cursed dagger or you reach Basic skill in daggers. There is little reason to keep the staff after this point unless you plan to wish for the Staff of Aesculapius, in which case you should continue training quarterstaff skill.\nPlayers disagree on whether Wizards should wear high-AC metal armor and focus on melee skills, or ignore all metal armor in favor of being able to use spells in combat. Wearing metal is fine if it doesn't encumber you and you're confident in your ability to survive without relying on magic. Not wearing it is fine if you're prepared to flee from monsters when you run low on energy. If you do choose to wear metal, you should plan to swap it out later for nonmetal armor as that gradually becomes available.\nSave your energy for when you really need it. You won't be able to cast force bolt more than a few times until you gain a few levels. \nRead any non-cursed spellbook as soon as you find it. You will always get a warning if there's a chance of failing to read it, and if you do, it's likely to be too high level to be of much use right now.\nIf you start with a wand of polymorph, you may consider polymorphing your starting spellbooks. Your force bolt book, since it is blessed, will polymorph into another blessed book that can thus be read with a 100% success rate. However, this can be done only once or twice before the spellbook becomes too faint to read. You can also polymorph your starting pet at the same time, often ending up with something much stronger for an early pet (though this risks killing it).\nRaising your Luck and maintaining it should be a priority. Finish the Mines and Sokoban when you feel ready.\nThe Wizard quest is fairly easy, the Dark One is a pushover, and the reward\u2014the Eye of the Aethiopica\u2014is so fantastically useful that a Wizard should probably go on the quest as soon as possible. One of the many things the Eye does is vastly enhance strategic mobility through the Mazes of Menace\u2014in particular, you can get out of trouble in an instant. Many Wizards set up a base camp in Sokoban and leave most of their worldly possessions there, going back whenever they need to read a spellbook or pick up more food. Adjacent monsters may follow you through the Eye's magical portal, but this also has its uses, such as luring wraiths out of a graveyard level.\nIf you have found the quest portal, but are not yet level 14, be aware that the first level of the quest, the Lonely Tower, is often well-provided with wraiths. You may be able to gain a few levels and reach XL 14 before you meet your quest leader.\nFor Wizards with the Eye and the magic missile and create monster spells, altar farming is incredibly easy, since an arbitrary number of corpses for sacrifice can be created on demand. This is good for increasing your Luck or obtaining more sacrifice gifts and favors. If you decide to get crowned, you will receive a spellbook of finger of death.\nYou can and should train daggers to Expert skill. Although Wizards don't get the multishot bonus at Skilled as of NetHack 3.6.0, throwing two daggers in a single turn is still powerful, so it is recommended to acquire a good number of daggers that stack together. Elven daggers are especially useful.\nAcquire Magicbane at this stage, unless you have some reason not to.\nIf you have come across a magic marker, you can blank other spellbooks and write useful ones like , , or .\nSince so many monsters are resistant to one or more forms of magical attack, you will need to build a diverse toolkit. A fire-resistant opponent may be especially vulnerable to cold attacks; an opponent with reflection can probably be brought down by splash effects from a . Reading the wiki entries for new opponents to learn their immunities and weaknesses is a good idea. Ultimately, nothing has \"stab resistance\"\u2014even shades will succumb to an enchanted or silver weapon\u2014so a Wizard should always have a good physical combat option to fall back on. Still, spells are generally the most powerful means of attack by this point in the game.\nSome players prefer to raise their experience level as high as possible in order to have the largest maximum HP and energy, and to maximize damage from casting magic missile. A level 30 Wizard gets 16d6 damage with each magic missile. Luring wraiths out of the Valley of the Dead and other graveyards will probably be required to reach this level. Remember to buy all the divine protection you want before trying to level up.\nOther players like to keep their experience level low, to keep higher-difficulty monsters from being generated. Ultimately, the choice is up to you.\nMagicbane remains an excellent weapon. With its magic resistance and ability to catch curses, you can fight powerful spellcasters like arch-liches head-on. Opinions vary as to whether you should enchant it to +7 or keep it at +2; see Magicbane#Enchanting for details.\nOther weapons such as Frost Brand, Stormbringer, or the Staff of Aesculapius are good options that do significantly more damage than Magicbane. \nYou should definitely have the spell in your repertoire by now. Save charges on your wands of death for when you really need them; e.g. when facing the Riders on the Astral Plane.\nThe helm of brilliance while not necessary, can be useful for reducing spell failure rates of difficult spells, or giving less capable wizards the benefit of hungerless casting.\nGetting a source of confusion for the Planes should be easy, since you probably have at least one useless forgotten spell like or .\nCasting spells when you have the Amulet of Yendor can drain your power very fast. You can drop it on the ground when you need to cast a lot of spells without moving. Also, consider stocking up on a few scrolls of charging and reading them when confused to restore all your energy immediately.\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1\u20132: Evoker\nBULLET::::- XL 3\u20135: Conjurer\nBULLET::::- XL 6\u20139: Thaumaturge\nBULLET::::- XL 10\u201313: Magician\nBULLET::::- XL 14\u201317: Enchanter/Enchantress\nBULLET::::- XL 18\u201321: Sorcerer/Sorceress\nBULLET::::- XL 22\u201325: Necromancer\nBULLET::::- XL 26\u201329: Wizard\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Mage\nThe Wizard quest sees you fighting the Dark One for the Eye of the Aethiopica.\nIn SLASH'EM, Wizards start with four spellbooks, with one book chosen randomly from each of:\nBULLET::::- ,\nSLASH'EM adds the rank titles Warlock/Witch (XL\u00a014\u201317), bumps Enchanter/Enchantress to XL\u00a018\u201321, Sorcerer/Sorceress to XL\u00a022\u201325, and removes the rank title of Necromancer (presumably, to avoid confusion with the new Necromancer role).\nWizards in SLASH'EM are a bit more difficult then in vanilla. In vanilla, once you get Magicbane you are likely to be on the road to ascension. Here, you had better stay sharp even after you get Magicbane. Keep your pet around you for longer. A good advice would be to stay careful and keep your pet until your AC is below \u221210 and your level is above 10.\nAn additional difficulty is that you don't have enough slots for all the extrinsics you would want. Dragon scale mail interferes with spellcasting now and generally isn't worth having in your ascension kit. In addition, you have to deal with the create pool spell and more serious level drain attacks.\nSome possible equipment choices:\nBULLET::::- Water walking boots: You need these to deal with create pool spells. You can use as a substitute to speed boots. The amulet slot is already crowded for other things, so no amulet of flying for you.\nBULLET::::- Ring of levitation with speed boots: With the ring, you are vulnerable to electric bugs. If you use this, you might want to blessed-genocide codice_1 to be safe, and this is no joke. The spell is dangerously unreliable (unless Skilled or better in escape spells).\nBULLET::::- Robe of protection: The highest natural AC for the body armor slot without spellcasting interference. It can be upgraded from plain robes with 50% chance. The robe of power is useless for a Wizard, unless you are wearing metallic armor. Robes take the body armor slot here, so you can't attempt to wear a robe of power on top of dragon scale mail.\nBULLET::::- Amulet of : You'll need to give up on the amulet of .\nBULLET::::- Wielding the hand of Vecna: It confers drain resistance. You can rely on the spell for the curses. Be careful of the blast if you are neutral.\nBULLET::::- Wielding Stormbringer if chaotic for drain resistance. You can obtain Stormbringer easily by crowning while carrying a spellbook of finger of death; this will also unrestrict broadsword skill. Without already carrying finger of death spellbook, you'll get that instead.\nBULLET::::- Wielding Nighthorn: It confers reflection, but it is two-handed, so if it gets cursed, you can't cast spells anymore. Also, being lawful, it will blast you for sure.\nBULLET::::- Depending on your situation, you could forgo reflection or drain resistance, but this is risky.\nBad ideas:\nBULLET::::- Wielding the Staff of Aesculapius: It doesn't confer drain resistance in SLASH'EM. Because it is two-handed, you can't cast spells if it gets cursed.\nBULLET::::- Wearing a shield of reflection: Your success rate will not be higher than 55% for and 25% for anything else.\nNice wishes:\nThe wallet of Perseus (unaligned) can help overcome the initial low carrying capacity of the Wizard, without wearing gauntlets of power.\nIn SporkHack, Wizards start with a spellbook of protection and a cloak of protection instead of a cloak of magic resistance.\nIn xNetHack, energy regeneration is increased by 0.33 per turn if the player is a Wizard. They start with four spellbooks (, and two random ones), but no potions, scrolls, rings, or wand.\n",
    "baalzebub": "Baalzebub\nBaalzebub, , is one of the demon princes who appears in Gehennom. He will be found in his lair, if you do not encounter him earlier. He is quite easy to defeat, though many consider him annoying because of his repeated use of a stunning gaze. Blindfold yourself and fight him on the up staircase; Elbereth is usually not necessary. \nIf you have enough gold, and if you are not wielding Excalibur, Baalzebub will ask you for money for safe passage.

In Christian demonology he is described as a demonic fly.\nThe D&D Baalzebul appears as a giant slug-like creature which trails feces and garbage wherever he goes. Flies crawl over his body at all times, and his arms are tiny and malformed.\nYou may find representations of him as a dark-skinned humanoid with compound insect eyes. According to D&D, he initially looked like that, but later he was punished by Asmodeus into his current form.\n",
    "dispater": "Dispater\nDispater, , is one of the demon princes. He is one of three not to have his own lair (the other two being Geryon and Demogorgon), and therefore is not guaranteed to appear. He is lawful and is is generated with a wand of striking.\nDispater has a lot of hit points, great magic resistance, and powerful spell attacks. In addition, he resists fire and poison. He'll follow you to other levels and try to steal the Amulet.\nDispater has no lair in vanilla NetHack. A spellcasting monster may summon him in Gehennom with the summon nasties spell, or a lawful demon (usually a prince; Asmodeus, Baalzebub, or Geryon) can gate him in.\nHe will not generally use his spellcasting attacks before he uses up his relatively harmless wand of striking. Therefore it is a very good idea to kill him as quickly as possible.\nNetHack's incarnation of Dispater is based on the unique archdevil of the same name found in Dungeons & Dragons source books. The \"City of Dis\" mentioned in the Encyclopedia entry does not appear in NetHack itself, although some variants add a lair inspired by it.\nIn the source material as well as in NetHack, Dispater's appearance is that of a handsome human about 2 meters (ca. 7 feet) tall. Unlike his NetHack incarnation, the D&D Dispater also has two small horns, a tail and a cloven left hoof.\nIn the real world, D\u012bs Pater was a Roman god of the underworld, later subsumed by Pluto or Hades (Hades was Greek). Originally a chthonic god of riches, fertile agricultural land, and underground mineral wealth, he was later commonly equated with the Roman deities Pluto and Orcus, becoming an underworld deity.\nIn SLASH'EM, all demon princes have lairs. Dispater's lair is located between levels 10-15 of Gehennom.\n",
    "succubus": "Foocubus\nThe term foocubus refers to an incubus or a succubus, especially one of the opposite sex of the character. Foocubi are demons that appear in \"NetHack\", and have a special seduction attack which can be used by high-intelligence and high-charisma players for its beneficial effects, although it is not without its risks.\nIn the vanilla game, all foocubi are heterosexual; an incubus will never try to seduce a male character, and a succubus will never seduce a female. If you chat to a foocubus of the same sex as you, it will \"cajole\" you, which has no effects. Trying to use a saddle on a foocubus results in YAFM (\"Shame on you!\"), as well as abusing your wisdom. \nIn addition to the usual methods of monster generation, foocubi can be summoned by kicking a sink or sacrificing a creature of your own race as a chaotic character. As a major demon, other major demons can gate them in, but they cannot summon other demons; they share this trait with another major demon, the balrog, though they may read a scroll of create monster should one be available. They also cannot be summoned by a cursed scroll of genocide. \nThe foocubus may begin the encounter of its own volition if it is hostile, or the player may begin the encounter with the #chat command.\nThe foocubus will attempt to remove all armor; with a probability of , they will ask, and will just remove the item. This process repeats for each item of armor you are wearing; the foocubus can only remove your suit if you have not kept your cloak on, and can only remove your shirt if you have not kept your cloak or suit on. A foocubus will never attempt to remove an amulet or blindfold, and will only affect rings if you have a ring of adornment; see below for details. If you are riding a mount, the foocubus might steal the saddle off the mount, dismounting you.\nIf, at this point, you are still wearing body armor or a cloak, the foocubus will leave you alone and try to teleport away (\"You're such a sweet ladynice guy; I wish...\"); otherwise, they will initiate an encounter. (\"Time stands still while you and the foocubus lie in each other's arms...\") This does not increment the turn counter.\nAt the end of the encounter, you will experience either a positive or a negative effect; the likelihood of a positive outcome depends on the sum of your intelligence and charisma stats. The probability of a positive effect is (IN+CH+1)/35. For this purpose, the sum of IN and CH is capped at 32, giving a minimum 5.7% chance of a negative effect, no matter how high your attributes are.\nAfter the encounter, whether positive or negative, the foocubus may try to take some gold from you as a payment and teleport away. The attempt will fail with a probability equal to your charisma out of 20 (or always, if you are polymorphed into a leprechaun). The amount taken usually consists of a 500zm flat fee, plus a random percentage of your current gold outside of any container. However, if you have more than 32757zm, the foocubus's percentage will not take into account any gold beyond that amount. If you have no gold in your main inventory, the foocubus will instead simply teleport away unpaid, with no change beyond an alternate message. (\"It's on the house!\") Furthermore, a peaceful foocubus will charge only 1/5 of the usual price\u2014rounded down, but always at least 1zm; a tame foocubus will never charge you.\nIf you got a positive effect, the foocubus will complain of having a headache and will do you no more favors for 1-100 turns. If you got a negative effect, the foocubus will be ready to go again immediately. However, in either case, there is a 1 in 25 chance that the foocubus will complain of a \"severe\" headache; this means that it has been cancelled, as if struck by the wand, and will never be able to seduce you again.\nIf the sum of your intelligence and charisma stats plus one is no less than a random number chosen between 1 and 35, you \"seem to have enjoyed it more than the foocubus...\" and experience one of the following positive effects with equal probability:\n! Effect !! Message\nConstitution increases by 1 and is exercised.\nYou feel good enough to do it again.\nWisdom increases by 1 and is exercised.\nYou will always remember the foocubus.\nHeals all hit points and exercises strength.\nYou feel restored to health.\nRestores all power and increases maximum by 1-5; exercises constitution.\nYou feel raised to your full potential.\nRaises your level by 1 and exercises wisdom. This increases your hit points and power, even if you are already level 30.\nThat was a very educational experience.\nThese last two positive effects are the main reasons to deliberately consort with foocubi (see strategy below), as they provide a very efficient way to gain XL, HP and power.\nIf, instead, the sum of your intelligence and charisma stats plus one is less than the random number chosen between 1 and 35, the foocubus \"seems to have enjoyed it more than you...\" and you experience one of the following negative effects with equal probability:\n! Effect !! Message\nConstitution reduces by 1 and is abused.\nYou are down in the dumps.\nWisdom reduces by 1 and is abused.\nYour senses are dulled.\nStrength is abused and you take 10-16 hit points of damage.\nYou feel exhausted.\nAll your power is lost, your maximum energy is reduced by 1-10 and your constitution is abused.\nYou feel drained of energy.\nYou lose 1 level unless you have drain resistance.\nYou feel out of shape. (if you lost a level); You have a curious feeling... (if drain resistant)\nFoocubi do very little melee damage, and are easy to kill even at low levels. As discussed further below, most of their negative seduction effects are also easy to cure. Their true danger lies with what seems like a humorous side effect of seduction: The player is left at least partly disrobed in the presence of any other monsters that happened to be in the room. Players who rely on armor items for reflection or MR can find themselves suddenly annihilated by attacks they would usually shrug off. As such, it is sensible to make absolutely sure that the immediate area is clear and that most monsters cannot close in on you post-encounter.\nThe probability of a beneficial effect from the encounter is (INT+CHA+1)/35. It is therefore a good idea to maximize charisma before consorting with foocubi. Intelligence also helps, but intelligence is the most difficult score to raise. For this reason, wizards are excellent for using foocubi and can often do so well from the beginning of the game. Maximizing charisma, however, is another matter.\nA ring of adornment can raise (or lower) charisma, but foocubi take an interest in them. An incubus may put it on your finger; a succubus may ask you for it, or just take it. The probability of asking, rather than just doing, is in both cases CHA/20 (where CHA is your charisma \"before\" donning or doffing the ring). A female character has a small advantage here, as she can keep a positively enchanted ring on and it will boost her chance of a positive effect. A male can only do this reliably if his charisma is thus boosted to at least 20, as the succubus will otherwise eventually steal the ring. On the other hand, male characters need not ever worry about \"negatively\" enchanted or cursed rings of adornment, nor having a ring of levitation replaced by a ring of adornment and possibly dropping him into water or lava. A tame succubus will eventually drop any stolen ring.\nMagic traps have an effect that causes you to gain a point of charisma and tame any monsters in the vicinity if they are tameable, resulting in some unusual pets (with the message \"You feel charismatic!\"). However, repeatedly stepping on a magic trap is most likely to have negative results, such as surrounding you with monsters after blinding and deafening you, or creating a tower of flame, as from a fire trap. Having fire resistance, a means of mitigating blindness (e.g. telepathy), and the ability to handle the summoned monsters is recommended; see the article on magic traps for more detailed information on how to handle such effects.\nMeanwhile, magic fountains have a 7 in 10 chance of increasing a random attribute by 1, or increasing all your attributes by 1 with a natural Luck of at least 4. However, there is no way to tell if a fountain is magical prior to quaffing, and the negative effects that quaffing from non-magical fountains can produce are much worse to deal with compared to magic traps, such as cursing your inventory; placing your items in a bag beforehand is a good idea, as is being prepared to deal with water moccasins or even a water demon. See the article on magic fountains for more detailed information. \nBeginning with NetHack 3.6.0, a foocubus will not put on or remove a ring of adornment if you are wearing gloves. He or she will attempt to remove your gloves, with the usual probability CHA/20 of asking first, before putting on or removing a ring. This does not affect succubi stealing rings of adornment that are not worn, because gloves do not impede this act.\nA helm of brilliance can raise (or lower) intelligence. As with all armor, the foocubus may try to take it off; with probability CHA/20, they will ask instead of just removing the helmet. Unlike rings of adornment, the foocubus will never keep the helmet; thus you can put it back on and still get the boost when you try again. Negative enchantments need not cause concern, as you can always give consent to take the helmet off.\nMost negative effects of seduction can easily be dealt with. Loss of wisdom or constitution can be cured by applying a unicorn horn. Hit points will heal over time (but don't consort with foocubi when you're nearly dead). If you lose a level, go and kill a wimpy monster or eat a tripe ration to get it back before playing with the foocubus again. Thus, it is possible for a low-intelligence or charisma character to still benefit from dealing with a foocubus, though the process is likely to be tedious. There is no cure for loss of maximum magical energy, and The NetHack Incubus and Succubus Spoiler suggests that if you care about this, you should wait until your intelligence and charisma are high enough that on average you will gain more magical energy than you lose.\nTo minimize post-assignation vulnerability, you should never voluntarily allow a foocubus to remove anything other than your cloak and body armor; an exception is if you are trying to get a cursed item removed. It is also wise to only consort with foocubi in an area you have emptied of other enemies. You can keep the foocubus out of the way while you do this by luring it up or down a level, or by using Elbereth whenever it approaches. For further details and special cases, see the \"Possible YASDs\" section below. Finally, remember to get dressed again afterward! \nTo prevent a foocubus from taking your gold, simply keep it in a container. In an emergency you can also drop it on the ground. A gentlemanly and/or ladylike player may wish to retain a small amount of gold in their inventory, so that the foocubus will receive at least a token payment for its services. \nAfter the foocubus develops a \"severe headache\", you can kill it and recover any gold it took from you; the only reasons for leaving it alive are strictly sentimental.\nIf you have Excalibur, Stormbringer or the Staff of Aesculapius, you can wield it for protection against the drain level effect.\nAs pets, foocubi are next to worthless in combat, but can still be #chatted to. Because they are demons, a foocubus cannot be tamed unless you are polymorphed into a demon; however, a foocubus is a valid polymorph form, and thus it is possible to polymorph an existing pet into a foocubus of the opposite gender (or swap gender yourself with an amulet of change or by polymorphing into a foocubus of the opposite gender yourself). Lying with a tame foocubus is no different from with a hostile or peaceful one; all problems including armor removal and self-cancellation remain. The key is that a tame foocubus is much easier to control, as you can lead it to a safe location before engaging it. Additionally, if you possess a magic whistle or move to a non-teleport level, it will not be necessary to chase down the foocubus after each encounter. A tame foocubus will also not be attacked by your pets and can be easily led away from any hostile monsters it would foolishly attack. Once the foocubus becomes cancelled, it should be abandoned or polymorphed; note that polymorphing a cancelled foocubus will create a cancelled monster, so you cannot polymorph it back into a useful foocubus.\nThere are several ways a foocubus can kill you outright, but they are generally easy to avoid.\nBULLET::::- Be cautious when using levitation boots or water walking boots; the foocubus may remove them, dropping you into water or lava.\nBULLET::::- If you are riding a flying steed (such as a dragon) over open water or lava, a foocubus may seduce it and remove the saddle, causing you to drown. However, being seduced yourself is safe in such a situation, so if you aren't the same sex as your steed, an encounter with a foocubus of the appropriate gender can be undertaken without hazard. However, you usually don't know the sex of your steed, so it's better to stay away from all foocubi in such a situation.\nBULLET::::- Females should be similarly cautious when using a ring of levitation on their left hand, wearing a second ring, and carrying a ring of adornment; an incubus may replace the ring of levitation with the ring of adornment.\nBULLET::::- Avoid wielding footrice corpses around foocubi unless you have charisma of 20 or more; they may remove your gloves.\nBULLET::::- Characters at experience level 1 should stay well away from foocubi, as one of the possible negative outcomes is a level drain. In practice, this means that low-level characters should not kick sinks.\nBULLET::::- Be sure to put back all of your clothing (armor) once you and the foocubus are done.\nBULLET::::- When entering Medusa's chamber, having a foocubus immediately seduce you and remove your only source of reflection or blindness will likely prove fatal. For this reason, redundancy is always good.\nFoocubi can remove any armor, including cursed armor; succubi can also remove cursed rings of adornment from male characters. Incubi can remove any cursed ring from female characters wearing two rings and carrying an additional ring of adornment. This provides an alternative to nymphs for ridding oneself of such items.\nPrior to NetHack 3.6.1, the outcome calculation used uncapped attributes, making it possible to guarantee a positive result with a combined IN and CH of at least 34.\n",

    "floating eye": "Floating eye\nA floating eye, , is a monster with a passive paralyzing gaze attack makes it very dangerous if handled incorrectly. The DevTeam does not consider the lack of any warnings about hitting a floating eye to be a bug. The encyclopedia entry does warn even unspoiled players of the danger.\nEating a floating eye corpse always conveys telepathy; only 50% of floating eyes will leave a corpse.\nThe floating eye has a passive gaze attack which causes paralysis. Every time you attack a floating eye with a melee attack, there is a chance that it will use its gaze attack against you if your attack did not kill it. If the floating eye has been cancelled, is blind, or if you cannot see the floating eye, it cannot use its gaze attack. If you have reflection or free action, the paralysis will not affect you.\nIf you are paralyzed, the length of time depends on your wisdom and the floating eye's level (typically 2 or 3). If your wisdom is 12 or lower, there is a 25% chance of being paralyzed for exactly 127 turns; otherwise you are paralyzed for (lvl\u00a0+\u00a01)d70 turns.\nThere is a chance that you will lose one point of Luck if you attack a blind floating eye.\nIf you are paralyzed by the floating eye's gaze, you are likely to be killed by even the weakest monsters such as newts or grid bugs. Because of this, floating eyes are the cause of many YASDs. Nonetheless, if you avoid hitting them in melee they are entirely harmless.\nTo kill a floating eye, it is best to use ranged weapons, polearms, or spells. If you do not have a powerful ranged attack, throw junk weapons or rocks. If you are in a room with the floating eye (rather than a corridor) and no other monsters are around, you can keep throwing your melee weapon at it and waiting for it to move so that you can retrieve your weapon. Finally, if wasting turns is not an issue, you can place yourself between the floating eye and an obstacle of some sort (such as a locked door, boulder, or passive creature) so the paralysis will cause no lasting damage other than wasting turns; however, you will then have to contend with hunger instead.\nFloating eyes cannot harm you if you are blind. Thus you may kill them in melee if you just first blind yourself, for example by wearing a blindfold or towel. Blinding the floating eye is also effective, but there is a chance of a \u22121 Luck penalty for hitting a blind floating eye. Another option is to zap it with a wand of make invisible or otherwise make it invisible, as long as you cannot see invisible.\nYou can apply a mirror to paralyze a floating eye, but this is not particularly useful as it will still be able to paralyze you.\nFloating eyes can also be cancelled with a wand or spell of cancellation.\nIn dNetHack, the duration of the paralysis effect is shortened to 2d6 turns, making them less dangerous to melee. However, it is still safest to attack them from range, as 12 turns is still enough time for other weak monsters to appear and kill a character.\nIn NetHack 4, it is impossible to attack a floating eye in melee without being protected from its gaze in some way. Monsters can still attack floating eyes normally and suffer paralysis. This was implemented to prevent aggravating deaths from early-game movement mistakes, as an accidental button press would often mean instant death.\nFloating eyes are given a new glyph\u2014 in UnNetHack, in xNetHack\u2014in order to improve visibility. In other regards, they are unchanged.\nEating a floating eye in Slash'EM Extended is not guaranteed to give telepathy. The paralysis effect from attacking them also has a much shorter time in this variant, making it much less dangerous to melee them.\n",
    "nurse": "Nurse\nA nurse is a hostile human monster. Nurses can attack you in melee, doing minor damage. On creation, they do not carry any weapons.\nIf you are wearing no armor and wielding nothing (not even a non-weapon), a nurse's attacks will instead heal you. Quivered items are allowed. If you are at maximum HP already, each hit from the nurse has a chance of raising your maximum (and current) HP by one point. The healing attack of the nurse will also cure food poisoning and illness, but not confusion, stunning, sliming, or stoning. If the nurse has been canceled, the healing effect will not work and the nurse will attack you normally.\nThe chance of a nurse raising your max HP is , provided that your maximum is less than 5\u00a0\u00d7 \"xlvl\"\u00a0+ [2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"xlvl\"]d10. This means that nurses are most effective when you have fewer than 7 hitpoints per level, and become completely ineffective when you have 25 hitpoints per level. No such restrictions apply if you're polymorphed to a monster, but any max HP increase acquired while polymorphed will only last until you revert to your original form.\nAfter healing you, a nurse has a chance of teleporting away. If you are on a non-teleport level, the nurse will flee for a while instead. If your maximum HP was raised, the nurse also has a chance of vanishing entirely.\nThe corpses of nurses also have remarkable healing properties. Eating one will restore you to your maximum hit points, however many this may be. (Even a potion of full healing is limited to restoring 400 HP.) Starting in NetHack 3.6.1, eating a nurse corpse will also cure blindness. Be warned, however\u2014nurses are human, and eating nurse meat is cannibalism for human characters. Nurse corpses are often tinned, as a tin of nurse meat has the same healing powers, and it does not count as cannibalism until you actually consume the tin (better to live as a cannibal than die of hit point loss). Beware: even a blessed tin can take one turn to open and another to actually consume, so do not wait until you are one turn from death.\nIf you encounter a nurse, and there are no other dangerous monsters nearby, the easiest way to strip yourself is to press and select all of your armor, plus your wielded weapon, for removal. Then you can let the nurse start healing.\nLetting many nurses heal you at once is known as nurse dancing. This is most often done by reverse-genociding nurses on a non-teleport level.\nIf you kill a nurse, and it leaves a corpse, you would be well advised to tin the remains. If eating human flesh is not cannibalism for you, or if you would be willing to endure the penalty to save your life, a tin of nurse meat will restore you to full hit points. You may wish to ensure the tin is blessed, so it will take only two turns to open and eat. Tinning the corpse, \"per se\", will not make you a cannibal, only eating the contents. So you can defer that decision until you are in grave difficulty.\nAs the nurse isn't a valid self-polymorph form, you cannot use this special attack on yourself. Additionally, pet nurses will not normally attack you, and thus cannot heal you. However, even pet nurses can be induced to attack you with conflict or left on a different level until they go untame. Pet nurses will attack enemies, even if they are not wielding anything and are wearing no armor. However, as nurses cannot heal themselves, wield weapons, or wear armor, they make weak pets.\nTo provide some clue as to the healing abilities of the nurse, they will say the following things when #chatted to:\nDuring combat, you are notified when you are healed by the following addendum to the traditional hit message:\nThere is no distinctive message for when your maximum HP is raised.\nIf you are a Healer, a (non-canceled) nurse will not hurt you even if you're wearing armor or wielding a weapon. Instead, you will occasionally receive the following message:\n",
    "tengu": "Tengu\nA tengu is a minor demon that appears in \"NetHack\". Its corpse is valued by many players, as it has a chance of granting teleport control (but can also grant teleportitis). Encountering tengus can be quite annoying as they extensively teleport themselves during combat after hitting. Unlike other minor demons, they are not susceptible to silver damage.\nThe wizard quest home, locate, and end levels often are pre-populated with several tengu. The Knight quest levels also generate many random i, including tengu, and they can be easily farmed with the abundance of magic traps surrounding the Isle of Glass.\nTengu are easier to kill in a no-teleport zone, such as Sokoban. In addition to reverse genociding them, Knights may also consider genociding quasits; as this makes up most of the monsters generated on the quest levels, this increases the chances of minor demons spawning, including tengu, which allows them to be farmed on the home level.\nContrary to popular belief, the chance of gaining teleport control from a tengu corpse is not higher if you already have teleportitis.\nPolymorphing into a tengu grants you teleport control, but this is a last resort because you can carry only 20.7% as much as your natural form.\nThis table shows how many tengu corpses you must eat to have the listed chance at feeling controlled:\n!Eaten corpses\n!Chance of control\nThis table shows how many tengu you must kill to have the listed chance at feeling controlled (includes the probability of leaving a corpse):\n!Killed tengu\n!Chance of control\nThis table shows how many cursed scrolls of genocide you must read to have the listed chance at feeling controlled:\n!Read scrolls\n!Chance of control\nIf you have a scroll of charging and a stack of blank scrolls, a newly generated magic marker can get you intrinsic teleport control about 83% of the time.\nTengu are demons or spirits in Japanese folklore. They are portrayed either as humanoid birds or having long noses. They are usually represented by characteristic fierce red masks with very long noses.\n",
    "oracle": "The Oracle\nThe Oracle is a monster who resides on a special level called \"The Oracle Level\" (or Delphi). She can provide a consultation for a fee, which is supposed to be one of the main ways the player learns about the game. In practice, players read spoilers, such as this one.\nThe Oracle Level is located between level 5 and 9 inclusive in the Dungeons of Doom. It is eligible to leave bones, and monster creation is biased towards neutral monsters. Immediately below the Oracle Level is the level with the entrance to Sokoban.\nThe Oracle's room, with fountains and centaur statues.\nThere are five rooms to the sides of the above area, containing the stairs (in separate rooms), five random monsters, three random traps, and six random items; they are linked to each other and to the above room by corridors. Each room has one trap, except the rooms with two objects or with the stairs up. The Oracle is at the center of the three by three room (called Delphi), amid the fountains. Delphi has a random empty doorway in one wall. There are two random monsters generated in the area surrounding Delphi. The marked statues are:\nBULLET::::- two forest centaurs (northwest and southeast)\nBULLET::::- two mountain centaurs (northeast and southwest)\nBULLET::::- four plains centaurs (north, west, south, and east).\nIf any of the centaur flavors are genocided or extinct, those statues will be replaced with statues of random creatures.\nThe statues are considered historic, and thus yield an alignment penalty if they are broken by an Archeologist. The statues also have a chance of containing a random spellbook.\nThe Oracle is a human , and always starts peaceful. Attacking her \"in melee\" causes a spray of magic missiles to hit you; she has no active attacks of her own. If you survive these magic missiles and #chat with her, you will get the message \"The oracle is in no mood for consultations.\" Killing her with ranged attacks will net no penalty except that of murder, but it's generally a bad idea.\nThe passive magic missile attack is not implemented for inter-monster combat in vanilla \"NetHack\", so any pet at level 11 or higher will attack and may kill the Oracle.\nDue to having a magic missile attack, she is magic resistant and therefore immune to the player's magic missiles. A wand of death does nothing to her either.\nThe Oracle offers two services. Minor consultations are true rumors, like you get from a blessed fortune cookie. A major consultation is an extended description of some aspect of the game, for example:\nMajor consultations can be found in the file oracles.txt, for players who are not inclined to pay as they go.\nConsultations cost money, but the first major and the first minor consultation you buy each increases your score and gives experience points. Buying a consultation of a type you've already bought gives neither experience nor score.\n!First consultation bought\n!Type \n!Cost\n!Score \n!Experience points \n!Cost/Score\n!Cost/XP\n!rowspan=\"2\"Minor\nMinor\n50\n21\n5\n2.38\n10\nMajor\n500 + (50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0XL)\n90 + (9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0XL)\n20 + (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0XL)\n5.56\n25\n!rowspan=\"2\"Major\nMajor\n500 + (50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0XL)\n210 + (21\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0XL)\n50 + (5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0XL)\n2.38\n10\nMinor\n50\n9\n2\n5.56\n25\nIf you take a major consultation, but do not have enough money to pay for it, the Oracle will take all your money and give a special oracularity which refers to . You won't get any experience for this and will \"use up\" your one chance at getting experience at the major level. Even the minor consultation will only give you 2 points afterwards. This can be trouble if you were relying on this for a pacifist character.\nThe oracle's consultations are stored in plain text in the source code, you can read the:\nBULLET::::- List of major consultations from\nBULLET::::- List of rumors from\nThe Oracle is primarily based on the , the priestess who presided over the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi; the \"NetHack\" Oracle will welcome you to \"Delphi\" when she spots you arriving at her abode. Some behavior is also in reference to the from rec.humor.oracle, which first appeared in 1989, as did the Oracle in NetHack 3.0.0.\nBoth of these predate the Oracle in \"The Matrix\" film series, which is not referenced.\nThe Oracle-level sound effects reference several different oracles:\nThe two hallucination sounds both reference the Internet Oracle:\nPacifist characters should use the Oracle for leveling up.\nThe Oracle will not get angry if you dry up the fountains or destroy the statues.\nIf you lack telepathy, the Oracle level can often be recognized by its slightly different assortment of monsters, e.g. naga hatchlings and baby dragons. This is because it counts as neutral for monster generation purposes, just like Sokoban.\nIn Fourk and FIQhack, the Oracle can grant enlightenment, at a cost of 20 gold per your experience level.\nIn SLASH'EM, the Oracle is able to use her passive attack on other monsters. If a woodchuck attacks the Oracle, the message associated with the attack is \"ZOT!\"\nIn UnNetHack, woodchucks will attack the Oracle on sight as part of Nephi's grudge patch, and the Oracle is able to use her passive attack on other monsters.\nUnNetHack also makes a few minor adjustments to the Oracle level. The level is generated with 1 guaranteed woodchuck, and monster generation is slightly tweaked. 93% of monsters are generated by the normal mechanism; the remaining 7% of monsters generated are according to the following probabilities:\nBULLET::::- 30% random\nBULLET::::- 10% s\nBULLET::::- 10% s\nBULLET::::- 10% s\nBULLET::::- 10% s\nBULLET::::- 10% random\nBULLET::::- 10% random\nBULLET::::- 10% random\nxNetHack adds two variations of the room in the center of the Oracle level. In both of them, the Oracle sits amid a ring of pools instead of a smaller room. One variant has some trees and only three fountains.\nLike UnNetHack, woodchucks and the Oracle attack each other on sight.\nBULLET::::- rec.humor.oracle\n",
    "lizard": "Lizard\nA lizard may seem at first like an unassuming monster, but in fact it is very helpful to any aspiring adventurer.\nKilling a lizard always leaves a corpse. Eating lizard meat, whether from a corpse or a tin, will cure stoning from a cockatrice, and a live lizard is completely invulnerable to this method of attack. It is usually better to eat the corpse since opening a tin may take many turns, and lizard corpses do not rot and never become old to cause sickness. Because of this, it is wise to keep at least one lizard corpse in your inventory.\nWhen playing during new moon, cockatrice hissing always begins the stoning process, unless a lizard corpse is carried in main inventory; with the corpse, the chance of stoning is restored to normal.\nA less useful effect of eating a lizard corpse is that it sets the remaining turns for confusion and stunning to two turns, which is trivial in comparison to the ability to stave off instadeath.\nNote that only actual lizard corpses will stop stoning; while other monsters represented by a such as newts and geckos are technically \"lizards\", their corpses do not share this property. Lizard corpses also do not prevent stoning from contact, e.g. accidentally touching a cockatrice corpse by feeling around on the floor without gloves while blind.\nLizard corpses are a very common autopickup exception.\nLizards first appear as live animals in NetHack 3.0.6, but the corpses occur as random objects in prior versions, all the way back to Hack 1.0. Stoning by hissing is an instadeath before Hack 1.0.3, and lizard corpses reduce confusion rather than affecting stoning. Hack 1.0.3 introduced gradual stoning and made it possible for lizard corpses to halt the stoning.\n",
    "small mimic": "Mimic\nMimics are a class of monsters whose main defense is to imitate an item or dungeon feature. Mimics can be small, large, or giant, and all three kinds are often located in shops and Sokoban. They are slow but powerful hitters, making them a common cause of death early in the game; small mimics rank #6 on the list of top deaths on NAO.\nLarge and giant mimics have a sticking attack, which prevents the player from escaping the confrontation. Walking into a concealed large or giant mimic, or finding it by searching when adjacent, will automatically stick you. The sticking attack can be protected against with magic cancellation.\nEating a mimic's corpse makes you imitate a pile of gold for a short time; if hallucinating, you will mimic an orange instead. This lasts for 20 turns in the case of a small mimic, 40 for a large one, and 50 for a giant mimic; in all three cases, the nutritional value is 10 times the time spent, so it's a net gain. Turning into gold is a weak form of polymorph: you won't polymorph if you have unchanging, and you'll fall off your steed if you are riding. However, armor and such is not affected and your stats are unchanged. This breaks polyselfless conduct as of 3.6.0 (although it did not in 3.4.3).\nA mimic is uncloaked when wearing a ring of protection from shape changers.\nThere is a (Dungeon level)% chance that a square in a shop that would normally have an item will instead get a mimic imitating a shop item.\nTwo giant mimics, imitating boulders, always appear on the final level of Sokoban.\nOf course, mimics can be randomly generated like most monsters can. Mimics can be items (in rooms), boulders, unaligned altars (in temples), and even closed doors (in doorways) or staircases (in rooms) in the dungeon. For example, the Rogue quest home level has four staircase locations, but three of these (chosen at random) are actually mimics.\nMimics sometimes display as \"mimic or strange object\" (,). In shops, the chance of this happening is 10*(10 - dungeon level)% on dungeon levels 1-9, and is 2/17 otherwise. You should not attempt to walk onto such objects, as they are always mimics. It is dangerous but not unusual to confuse these with the armor symbol, which is outside the Rogue level, or with a chest () in the tiles interface.\nIf you have warning, anything that is an item when you can see it and a warning when you can't may be a mimic. If you are warned of a monster, and then see an item where the warning was, it is probably a mimic (or a snake or insect hiding under the object). Do not walk onto the mimic to discover it, however, as doing so will cause you to stick to it. Throw a rock or piece of gold at it, instead.\nPriests and others with a healing spell can cast it at an object; this will produce a message such as \"The wand seems a more vivid white than before,\" if directed at a mimic.\nIf you have telepathy, a mimic will be readily visible as such, unless you are hallucinating, in which case the mimic will appear as a random monster that does not move, assuming it is still asleep.\nA method of checking shops for the presence of mimics is to throw 1 gold piece across the shop, as it is not lost but added to your store credit\u2014but be careful that you don't anger the shopkeeper by hitting him/her with the coin.\nAnother method is the \"One of these things is not like the others\" method; if you walk into a shop that sells specific items and notice something that doesn't quite fit, chances are it's a mimic. This goes especially for chest- or armor-like \"strange objects\".\nApplying a stethoscope on a cloaked mimic will also reveal it and wake it.\nIf you find yourself fighting a mimic, then hit and run is generally the best strategy as long as the mimic is not stuck to you. If it is, try Elbereth.\nWhile mimics can be dangerous, they are exceedingly slow and are worth a fairly large amount of experience. Characters with relatively high starting HP and AC, like valkyries, samurai and barbarians can attack more safely, but even the weaker classes can defeat mimics without taking a single hit if you are careful. Assuming you are unburdened, you should get at least 4 moves for the mimic's every 1 move. Just stay a short distance from it until it comes towards you, then attack three times, retreat one step, and repeat. Be careful of bumping into another mimic! Also, it is recommended that you wake up the mimic from a range (throw a gold piece or rock at it) to ensure that you don't get hit by it. Remember that mimics are worth enough experience points to make you advance a level; therefore, to take best profit of them it is usually best to wait till you are level 3 or more before dispatching them.\nIf you find one outside a shop, shoot it repeatedly. This works best for rogues and rangers, though wizards can do this well, too. However, beware of using ranged attacks if you are in a shop\u2014any missiles will automatically become the store's property, if the store buys that type of item. Spells of force bolt can destroy fragile items like potions\u2014which you will have to pay for\u2014and of course will hit the shopkeeper if he/she is standing behind the mimic.\nMimics are a surprising candidate for early genocide or extinction. Since mimics are sometimes generated in place of shop items, preventing the game from generating more will make future shops better-stocked. This is a relatively small effect except in Orcus-town, where it will greatly increase the number of real items in the abandoned shops.\nBeing polymorphed into a mimic (for instance, by a polymorph trap), is a rather bad situation. Mimics are not fast, do not have a lot of strength, and the large and giant versions even make you tear out of your armor and/or cloak. Furthermore, mimics do not have limbs, and are therefore unable to wield a weapon. The only thing which may help is attempt to hide via the #monster command.

This will make you mimic an object, and is not particularly useful, since monsters are able to easily find you. Returning to your original form is the best option.\n",
    "tourist": "Tourist\nThe Tourist is one of the roles in NetHack. Since the Tourist has low starting stats and can only reach Expert in three weapons, running a Tourist is quite the challenge. Tourists always start as a neutral human.\nThe Tourist is inspired by Terry Pratchett's \"\" books; Twoflower, the tourist from these books, stars as the quest leader for the Tourist role.\nThe guidebook has this to say about Tourists:\nBULLET::::- 1\u20131000 gold pieces\nBULLET::::- 21\u201340 +2 darts\nBULLET::::- an uncursed expensive camera with 30\u201399 charges\nBULLET::::- an uncursed credit card\nBULLET::::- 10\u201320 random items of food\nBULLET::::- 4 scrolls of magic mapping\nBULLET::::- 2 potions of extra healing\nBULLET::::- a +0 Hawaiian shirt\nBULLET::::- 4% chance of a tin opener; otherwise:\nBULLET::::- 4% chance of a leash; otherwise:\nBULLET::::- 4% chance of a towel; otherwise:\nBULLET::::- 4% chance of an uncursed magic marker\nBULLET::::- XL 10: Searching\nBULLET::::- XL 20: Poison resistance\nTourists start with Basic skill in \"Dart\". Despite not starting with a melee weapon, they start Unskilled in \"Bare hands\", because only roles which can reach Master start with Basic skill in \"Bare hands\", and Tourists can only reach Skilled.\nCompensating somewhat for the Tourist's poor starting equipment is the fact that a Tourist can advance to basic skill in every type of weapon except clubs. Therefore, a Tourist can make use of almost any weapon without restriction.\nShopkeepers recognize Tourists below experience level 15 as suckers and charge them an extra markup when buying and only offer the base price of sold items. (The same problem will be experienced by other roles when wearing a visible shirt or dunce cap.)\nTourists tend to start with comically low HP and strength, and no real armor to speak of. Thus, the early game must be played with extreme caution. Unlike most other roles, Tourists need to rely heavily on items that they find.\nIt is critical to find armor as soon as possible. Tourists should use their starting pet to curse-test every weapon and piece of armor that they find. Non-cursed armor should be worn immediately, unless it encumbers you. In the early game, the most common source of magical armor items is an armor shop, and Tourists typically start out with enough gold to buy most of the good items in the shop.\nHeading directly for Sokoban or Minetown is a valid strategy, but the monsters may get too difficult too quickly. A very cautious strategy is to wait somewhere around dungeon level 3 or so and kill easy monsters until you gain a few levels, then descend deeper. \nThe initial stock of 21\u201340 +2 darts should be viewed as a bridge to a better weapon. Each dart will, on average, last for 4 throws (given that each dart has a chance of breakage per throw), which means that Tourists will get about 84\u2013160 dart throws before the supply is exhausted. Once a better weapon is found, any remaining darts should be kept for use in attacking monsters from long range. \nAt low experience levels, it is difficult to hit anything with a weapon in which you are unskilled, since unskilled usage confers a \u22124 to-hit penalty. Hence, unless you find a high-damage weapon such as a dwarvish mattock or two-handed sword, you find a highly enchanted weapon, or you are facing weak monsters, it is much safer to kill things by throwing your darts in the very early game. Once you do find a weapon that you want to train, you can use it on non-threatening monsters (such as lichens, fog clouds, and grid bugs) and save your darts for true challenges.\nBy the time you reach experience level 5 or thereabouts, you will often have found a better weapon (such as a dwarvish mattock, two-handed sword, long sword, silver saber, or unicorn horn), which you can start using in place of the darts since your experience level is now high enough to partly offset the unskilled to-hit penalty. Of course, your weapon will not \"stay\" unskilled for long; you should advance it to at least basic as quickly as possible.\nThe most useful starting item for a Tourist is the expensive camera. The camera, when applied, will blind any monster standing in the way of the flash. This is a good survival tactic, since you can then run away while the monster is blinded. If you lack a towel or blindfold, you can also flash yourself for temporary blindness to use telepathy or avoid a gaze attack.\nA survival tool for the early Tourist is to write Elbereth in the dust. This may scare monsters away, allowing your pet to kill them while you retreat. Keep in mind that monsters blinded by your expensive camera will not respond to Elbereth!\nThe credit card is useful for opening locked doors and chests without having to kick, bash, or pry them open. A key is still better if you can find one, because it can also re-lock them.\nTourists tend to start with a high charisma, which allows them to consort with foocubi effectively.\nOnce you are able to bring your AC down below zero, and you obtain a better weapon than the starting darts, you have a reasonable chance at going after the luckstone in Mines' End and the prize at the end of Sokoban. After that, continue down the dungeon until you find the portal to the quest.\nThe quest artifact for the Tourist is the Platinum Yendorian Express Card. This artifact is so useful that in most cases a Tourist should try to complete the quest as soon as possible. The most important intrinsic to have for the quest is reflection, because the quest's locate and goal levels contain several large rooms filled with soldiers armed with attack wands. The Master of Thieves, the quest nemesis, is not particularly difficult compared to other quest nemeses, and any character capable of dispatching the soldiers should have no special trouble with him.\nThe quest also contains a sizable amount of loot: between the many shops, barracks and graveyard treasure, and items generated along with the spiders, you will likely find an ascension kit item or two. Consider postponing sitting on the two thrones until you loot the entire branch. Further, the lower levels have several guaranteed captains, which have a good chance of carrying at least one silver saber.\nIn this part of the game, the best single melee weapon for a Tourist is a unicorn horn. Even though unicorn horns deal slightly less damage per hit than an equivalent dwarvish mattock, the unicorn horn can be advanced to Skilled, whereas mattocks can only be advanced to Basic. Also, dwarvish mattocks are quite heavy, whereas a unicorn horn is something that you should be carrying around anyway for the healing properties. Typically, a Tourist with a well-enchanted unicorn horn should have no problem completing the quest and the Castle. Tourists can also become skilled at two weapon combat, so another option is to wield a pair of good one-handed weapons (such as two silver sabers).\nTourists should seek out the same types of armor that a warrior-type character such as a Valkyrie or Barbarian would use. In most cases, it is not worth avoiding metal armor to improve spell casting rates, because Tourists suffer enormous spell casting penalties from even one peripheral piece of metal armor, and it is not practical to avoid metal armor entirely. Typical armor for a mid-game Tourist would be a mithril-coat, iron shoes, a dwarvish iron helm or orcish helm, and an elven cloak or dwarvish cloak, with perhaps one or two pieces of magical armor.\nIn the advanced stages of the game, a Tourist should have several artifact weapons available from which to choose. Because Tourists have no weapon restrictions to speak of, any decent artifact weapon is a good choice. However, if you have a choice, the following weapons are especially desirable and are worth pursuing if your character has the opportunity (e.g., via a wish):\nBULLET::::- Grayswandir \u2013 Tourists can advance sabers to Skilled. In most cases it must be obtained from a wish, since Tourists start out neutral. It can then be dual-wielded with another silver saber; this is the most powerful melee weapon combination for an endgame Tourist.\nBULLET::::- Magicbane \u2013 Tourists can advance daggers to expert and can get this by sacrificing.\nBULLET::::- Mjollnir \u2013 Unless the enemy is shock-resistant, this weapon inflicts the most damage out of all the aligned weapons that a Tourist can obtain by sacrificing.\nTourists can become skilled in two-weapon combat, but this only becomes useful late in the game, when good weapons are available. Using two weapons is preferred unless your character needs a shield for reflection. For ranged weapons, highly enchanted darts or daggers work well, since both are readily available and Tourists can get to Expert skill in both daggers and darts. Of the two, darts are preferable since Tourists suffer a multishot penalty for all other weapons.\nWith regards to armor selection, a Tourist is no different from any other role and should follow the same guidelines as any other character in terms of assembling the various pieces of armor that form a typical ascension kit.\nThe main function of the Platinum Yendorian Express Card is that it can be #invoked to charge wands and tools like a scroll of charging. Properly exploited, this function gives the Tourist the equivalent of a blessed scroll of charging every few hundred turns, a feat which is not possible with any other role. This makes the Tourist role one of the easiest to ascend once the quest has been completed.\nWands have an increased chance of exploding each time they are charged, so a post-quest Tourist will usually want to keep several of each type of wand on hand to maximize the number of recharging opportunities. For rare wands, such as wands of death, a small number of such wands will last an entire game if properly managed. For common wands, such as wands of digging, it is a good idea to maintain a rotating stock of such wands, discarding the ones which have been charged many times and replacing them with newer ones.\nThe Platinum Yendorian Express Card can also be used to charge tools. This is especially useful because most tools, unlike wands, can be recharged infinitely many times. For example, a horn of plenty combined with the Platinum Yendorian Express Card means that a Tourist can get by with carrying very little food. A bag of tricks can be used to create monsters indefinitely. Other useful chargeable tools include brass lanterns, crystal balls, tinning kits, magic harps, magic flutes, fire horns, frost horns, the Bell of Opening, and even the expensive camera that comes in the initial inventory.\nCertain rings can be charged with the Platinum Yendorian Express Card as well. You may want to wear a +6 or +7 ring of increase damage full time, especially for two weapon combat. Since rings can explode when charged, a good strategy is keep two of the same type of ring, and charge the one with the lowest charge, so as to not risk destroying a highly charged ring.\nBecause the game will not display the number of charges and recharges on an unidentified item, a spellbook of identify may be a valuable item for a Tourist. Tourists can reach basic skill in divination spells, which is more than enough to cast identify.\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1\u20132: Rambler\nBULLET::::- XL 3\u20135: Sightseer\nBULLET::::- XL 6\u20139: Excursionist\nBULLET::::- XL 10\u201313: Peregrinator/Peregrinatrix\nBULLET::::- XL 14\u201317: Traveler\nBULLET::::- XL 18\u201321: Journeyer\nBULLET::::- XL 22\u201325: Voyager\nBULLET::::- XL 26\u201329: Explorer\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Adventurer\nThe Tourist quest sees you fighting the Master of Thieves for the Platinum Yendorian Express Card.\nIn SLASH'EM, a Tourist may also be a doppelganger or a hobbit.\nSporkHack offers a wider selection of races for various roles. An orc Tourist is an interesting choice that starts with potions of sickness; dipping the starting darts into one offers an instant kill attack from the second move.\nIn UnNetHack, items in shops are automatically identified when playing as a Tourist, regardless of whether the player has seen them before or not. Similarly, selling unidentified items will automatically identify them. Enchantments and BUC status are not identified.\nIn FIQHack, tourists ID shop items in the same manner as UnNetHack. Additionally, a Tourist may be a gnome.\n",
    "wood nymph": "Nymph\nNymphs are a class of monsters in \"NetHack\" represented by . The class contains the three nymph species: water nymph, wood nymph, and mountain nymph.\nWhen you dip an item into or quaff from a fountain, there is a chance of summoning a water nymph.\nNymphs are the first quest enemy class for Rogues, with a 14% chance of being generated in the quest branch. The Rogue quest home level also has nine guaranteed water nymphs, and each of the filler levels has two water nymphs. \nNymphs have a 50% chance of being generated with a mirror and an independent 50% chance of carrying a potion of object detection. Nymphs are generated asleep 80% of the time; if you have the Amulet of Yendor or summon one via a fountain, they are guaranteed to be generated awake.\nNymphs all share the same base attributes. They are not strong attackers and have a weak base AC, but are nevertheless very dangerous monsters that teleport frequently while moving. While they cannot directly inflict damage, nymphs are capable of charming you into removing your armor and stealing it or other items before attempting to teleport away. They are also capable of using said items, putting on armor and amulets as well as zapping wands and quaffing potions. Eating a nymph's corpse has a chance of giving you teleportitis.\nA water nymph shares the same qualities and attributes as her other counterparts, but can also swim and freely cross water.\nNymphs generally should not be approached unless you can reliably dispatch them before they steal any items; in most cases, it is preferable to leave them asleep if possible and avoid them. It may be advisable to leave the items you least want stolen in a chest or other container elsewhere before nearing or pursuing a nymph. When dealing with an awake nymph, remember that she is as fast as your unburdened character at base speed.\nIn a situation where a nymph nearby is awakened, Elbereth can ward her off and give you some valuable space. Applying a mirror at a nymph will cause her to steal the mirror and teleport away, which can preserve your more valuable or dangerous items; nymphs also have a chance of being tamed using a wooden harp, but this is not reliable. It is also ideal to keep your pet nearby and use them to hold the nymph at bay and hopefully kill her for you, though they can still steal items if your pet is holding any; early Wizards in particular will want to go this route unless they have access to magic missile or an attack wand that can reliable kill or immobilize her.\nRanged attacks are the most ideal for killing nymphs before they can close in on you; the exception to this is the spell or wand of striking, which can kill the nymph but will also affect the inventory she drops if it does. This includes breaking any stolen potions and especially the mirror they are often generated with\u2014breaking mirrors results in a \u22122 Luck penalty, which most characters cannot afford at the point they first encounter nymphs.\nA wand of sleep can stop a nymph long enough for you to kill her, hopefully before the combat awakens her; a wand of cancellation will make the nymph \"plain\", which renders her harmless, but she will still teleport away after unsuccessfully attempting to steal from you. However, wands in general are risky due to the chance that they can be stolen and potentially used against you; worse, a wand of all but ensures that she will escape you several times. Polearms or lances \"can\" be effective, but you will likely need fast speed or better to consistently keep them one square away while you attack.\nNymphs and their theft attacks can be used to get rid of cursed items, usually by stashing or dropping every other item besides the ones you want removed. You can then let the nymph steal them, and optionally retrieve the items if you want to uncurse them later. Punished players can also use this to untether themselves from their heavy iron ball.\nAs a polymorph form, becoming a nymph will not affect your armor, and grants two unique abilities:\nBULLET::::- You can remove an iron chain with the #monster command.\nBULLET::::- You can steal gear from monsters without killing them.\nTo steal, attack the monster; if you are wielding a weapon, you will attack with that weapon and also make a steal attempt, but you will not attack bare-handed if not wielding a weapon.

(\"You smile at monster seductively.\") If the attack misses, the monster will treat it like any other missed attack, and peaceful monsters will likely become angry. (\"You pretend to be friendly.\") Be sure to check the AC of pets or peaceful monsters before stealing from them.\nIf you are invisible and the monster cannot see you, the seduction attack will not work; you will still steal items, but also make a regular attack even without a weapon, possibly angering the monster.\nA tame nymph is not a particularly good pet due to her weak attributes, especially in a no-teleport level, but is very occasionally used to steal items from other monsters, though this can often fail. When a nymph attempts to steal from a peaceful monster, it will attack her; since nymphs are incapable of attacking, she will just keep attempting to steal until successful, then teleport away. After teleporting away, she will quickly drop whatever she stole, requiring you to find her new location and retrieve the items; you may have to fight the monster in question regardless.\nIn xNetHack, nymphs hate the touch of iron and take an additional d6 damage when struck with an iron item. Players polymorphed into nymphs take d3 damage when handling iron items. Also, nymphs introduce themselves before charming you; they have classical Greek-style names.\n",

    "wizard of yendor": "Wizard of Yendor\nThe Wizard of Yendor, (also informally known as Rodney), is one of the main antagonists in \"NetHack\". As he is the guardian of the Book of the Dead, you must steal the Book from him, usually through a fight to the death, before you can descend into Moloch's Sanctum and snatch the Amulet of Yendor from the high priest of Moloch.\nHowever, killing him alone will not be enough to deter him; not only can he hassle you remotely with mysterious curses and spells, the Wizard will eventually reappear stronger than ever, and he can and will follow you up to the Elemental Planes. He will not appear in the Astral Plane; however, if he appears on the Plane of Water, he can follow you through the portal to the Astral Plane.\nIn addition to the full complement of arcane monster spells, up to and including the touch of death, the Wizard has a unique spell, Double Trouble, which creates another incarnation of him with all his powers. The clone can show up with a different appearance from his normal self; one of water demon, vampire, red dragon, troll, umber hulk, xorn, xan, cockatrice, floating eye, guardian naga or trapper. He will not use this spell if there are already two of him in the world.\nHe is incapable of harming monsters, e.g. pets or the high priest of Moloch. The latter case is frequent in NetHack 3.4.3 because he may appear within twelve turns after you perform the Invocation, and will immediately warp into the Sanctum to obtain the Amulet from the high priest. As of NetHack 3.6.0, covetous monsters won't attack the priest.\nThe Wizard of Yendor is always generated residing in his Tower in Gehennom. He is generated without a weapon.\nAfter the Wizard dies for the first time, or after you perform the Invocation (if you have stolen the Book from him without killing him), he will cause you trouble for the rest of the game. Fifty to 299 turns after the wizard is first killed, 2\u201312 turns after you perform the Invocation and every 50\u2013249 turns afterwards (not counting turns where you are invulnerable while praying), one of the following effects will happen:\n!Probability \n!Effect \n!Message\nNo effect\n\"You feel vaguely nervous.\"\nCurse items\n\"You notice a black glow surrounding you.\" (if not blind)\nAggravate monsters, as per the monster spell\n\"You feel that monsters are aware of your presence.\"\nSummon nasties\nNo message\nIf there is currently no living Wizard, he returns to life near you, one monster level higher than his previous incarnation. If the Wizard is alive on a different dungeon level, and doesn't have the real Amulet, he is brought to you.\n\"A voice booms out... 'So thou thought thou couldst kill/elude me, fool.'\"\nIn addition, the Wizard always reappears immediately when you enter the Plane of Earth. On the Astral Plane, the Wizard cannot appear, and every other effect has equal probability.\nUnrelated are various cosmetic messages that \"harass\" the player (e.g. \"laughing fiendishly\").\nIn UnNetHack, there is one additional possible effect of this harassment\u2014if you aren't on the Astral Plane, there is a chance of a large earthquake, similar to the effect of playing a drum of earthquake.\nTo take him down the first time, simply zap a wand of death at him while he's sleeping and hope it doesn't miss. Fighting him fairly in his tower can be inconvenient, as the Wizard can fly and thus might drop the Book of the Dead underwater when killed, and it will need to be recovered. During the ascension run, make sure you have magic resistance on as often as possible, as the Wizard may reappear at any inconvenient moment and quickly lead to a YASD. Many players choose to zap a wand of death at the Wizard instantly every time he reappears. However, if you are low on wand charges, you may want to take him out by conventional means or, for example, stoning him. Watch out for the Elvenkings the Wizard likes to summon\u2014they are represented by the same symbol as the Wizard, and it's annoying to realize that you've squandered a ray of death on the wrong monster.\nBeing covetous, the Wizard is capable of stealing quest artifacts from your main inventory. If you were relying on that carried artifact for magic resistance, look out&mdash: he can not only remove your MR, but steal it for himself! Not only is he is now immune to death rays and the like, but he might be inclined to return the favor. Prudent players will arrange for other items to duplicate the vital powers of their quest artifacts before beginning the ascension run, and may even wish to carry their own quest artifact in a container to avoid the Wizard stealing it and making use of it himself. Pity the unprepared Caveman who has the Sceptre of Might stolen with no other source of MR \"and\" no other good melee weapon in inventory.\nIn NetHack 3.6.0, he will only steal the player's own quest artifact\u2014those of other roles are immune (e.g. a neutral non-wizard can get theft-proof MR by wishing for The Eye of the Aethiopica). As of NetHack 3.6.1, any quest artifact is vulnerable, so this is no longer a viable strategy.\nThe Wizard will also steal any and all of the invocation items, such as the Bell of Opening and his own Book of the Dead.\nThe Wizard will not reappear to harass you if he obtains the real Amulet, but he will still be hostile and will need to be killed to reobtain it. If you are being overwhelmed by the Wizard, you can throw the Amulet away and change levels as he goes to pick it up. You will need to retrieve the Amulet at some point, but this gives you an opportunity to recover pets and equipment. However, the other forms of harassment will continue to affect you.\nAttacking the Wizard through the corner\nIt is possible to dig into the Wizard's tower without waking him up: standing in a corner of the room, zap a wand of digging diagonally at the tower. This will remove a bit of the tower, but will not wake up the Wizard. This will happen, just outside your visual field with no message; don't move to check it out. Without having moved, If you then shoot a death ray in through this newly created gap, you will kill him without giving him the chance to cast spells at you. You have to do all this from the same position. If you dig in any other way, or if you get near the breached tower, you will wake him up.\nIf you kill him over the moat, you can get the Book of the Dead by zapping a wand of cold or the spell over the water; the Book of the Dead is immune to blanking, and will end up on top of the ice. Alternately, you can wear an amulet of magical breathing to go into the water and pick it up. If you choose to do this, remember to leave your water-damageable items (potions, spellbooks, scrolls, non-rustproof weapons) on the dry land or in a noncursed oilskin sack.\nIf you have a drum of earthquake, you can reliably wake him up from \"outside\" the Wizard's Tower. You can then kill him and obtain the Book without having to enter the Tower at all. A tame (master) mind flayer can also lock onto him with its telepathy, waking him up and bringing him to you. If you polymorph into a mind flayer, you have a 10% chance of locking into his mind each time you #monster, provided he is within an eight-tile radius. Drinking a cursed potion of invisibility will also wake him up, along with all other sleeping and meditating monsters on the level.\nOnce you have killed the Wizard or performed the Invocation ritual, the harassment will begin and will last for the remainder of the game. Thus it is usually a good idea to prepare for the ascension run before killing him to reduce the number of turns\u2014and thus the amount of harassment\u2014needed to finish the game. Finding the vibrating square and creating paths through the Gehennom mazes are always beneficial. Stealing the Book of the Dead without killing him will allow you to continue preparations without risk of harassment; this is especially useful for pacifists trying to raise the dead to obtain a level 49 purple worm.\nLevel draining the Wizard will permanently reduce the level of this incarnation, although it will still increase when another one appears. If you are able to reduce his level to 0 he will lose all spellcasting abilities, and his melee damage becomes unremarkable. Reducing his level without killing him is best done with a negatively enchanted Stormbringer (enchantment can be easily reduced to \u22123 through engraving). Reducing his level will also make him more susceptible to polymorph; polymorphing him will prevent his covetous teleportation and remove most of his abilities. Your pets can also begin to attack him on their own initiative once he approaches their level. Sliming is also an option.\nTeleporting the Wizard will always move him to the upstairs, or the down ladder if you are within his tower. As he is covetous, this is rarely a concern as he can simply warp himself back to your position; if you managed to polymorph or slime the Wizard first, you will not be able to teleport him away from the staircase.\nThe Wizard normally cannot be made tame or peaceful, but there are a handful of methods to pacify him if you are able to polymorph him. (Usually, you have to slime him first.) The Wizard will always be made hostile when he next revives, so these methods cannot be used to permanently pacify him.\nBULLET::::- Polymorph him into a unicorn and throw him a gem. (It is not necessary to use a co-aligned unicorn nor a valuable gem.)\nBULLET::::- Polymorph him into a snake and successfully use a wooden flute.\nBULLET::::- Polymorph him into a nymph and successfully use a wooden harp.\nBULLET::::- Polymorph him into any undead monster and read the blessed Book of the Dead.\nBULLET::::- As a chaotic priest or knight outside of Gehennom, polymorph him into any undead and successfully turn undead.\nBULLET::::- Polymorph him into any non-human, non-mindless monster and #untrap it from a pit that you did not create. Failure from the monster weighing too much, or success, both have chances of pacifying the wizard, but failure will leave him trapped, allowing you to try again.\nBULLET::::- In SLASH'EM, polymorph him into any monster and hit it with a potion of amnesia. This effect can be resisted by the monster's MR.\nThe Wizard of Yendor first appeared in Hack 1.0.2.\nThrough NetHack 2.3e, he appeared in a 1x2 room in the center of the maze, which also contained a hell hound (that did not have a breath weapon) and the Amulet of Yendor. The room had no doors and was surrounded by a moat. His symbol was 1, rather than @. These versions of NetHack did not have color.\nFake Wizard rooms had a demon (generic in this version) instead of the Wizard, and a fake Amulet.\nFrom NetHack 3.0.0 through 3.0.10, the Wizard lived in a larger tower, now also accompanied by a vampire lord. NetHack acquired color display in version 3.0.4.\nFake Wizard rooms had a randomly chosen demon prince, or demon lord if no demon prince was available, or a random demon if demon lords were also gone; at the time, all eight modern named demons existed, and occurred only in fake Wizard rooms or when summoned.\nStarting with NetHack 3.1.0, the Amulet is now given to the high priest of Moloch, and the Wizard instead carries the Book of the Dead. The 3.0.x-style Wizard room still exists as the room in which the Wizard lives, as well as a similar room on the first level of the Wizard's Tower, and as the two \"fake Wizard\" levels.\n",
    "chameleon": "Chameleon\nThe chameleon, , is the most common and well-known of the shapeshifters in \"NetHack\". They have a 1/6 chance per turn of changing forms: chameleons will change into an animal 2/3 of the time, and a random monster the rest of the time.\nEating a chameleon corpse causes you to polymorph unless you have unchanging.\nSeveral chameleons are guaranteed to appear on the home level of the Rogue quest.\nChameleons are quite capable of imitating summonable \"nasties\" such as arch-liches, which can spell death for the unprepared. They should therefore be treated with caution, and dealt with quickly whenever possible. Wearing a ring of protection from shape changers will revert them to their much easier base form, which can only do 8 damage as most by biting.\nEating a chameleon corpse will polymorph carnivorous pets as well, most likely into something useless, which is one of the dangers of leaving carnivorous pets (especially purple worms) near chameleons. It also pays to mind the corpse monsters leave, as eating a chameleon corpse yourself without realizing it will most likely cause a lot of misery, especially for your armor.\nA chameleon in the form of a domestic animal can be tamed with the appropriate food, and will remain tame even as it changes forms. Unfortunately, it is very likely to polymorph into a weak form and die, and it cannot be predicted when it will change into something useful. You can improve it, however, by displacing it onto a polytrap while wearing a ring of protection from shape changers.\nBecause polymorphed monsters return to their natural form upon death, pet chameleons are much more useful; while they can still die in their chameleon form, dying or self-destructing while polymorphed will allow them to shapeshift again eventually, and there is more value in their more powerful forms as a result.\nThe chameleon is a real-life animal noted for its camouflaging abilities that it uses to hide itself from prey and predators alike. In some fantasy works, such as the \"Xanth\" series from which the encyclopedia entry originates, this is extended to full-on shapeshifting.\n",
    "rothe": "Rothe\nA rothe is one of the deadlier early-game monsters. They have many attacks and often appear in packs, somewhat similar to soldier ants.\nThey resemble musk oxen or like an imposing woolly ox/bull. They aren't rodents.\nBULLET::::- Fortunately, rothes are larger and move slower than ants, making them far more susceptible to wands.\nBULLET::::- Rothes respect Elbereth.\nBULLET::::- Rothes only provide 100 nutrition, but appear in groups, so they make a good source of food.\nBULLET::::- They also frequently leave corpses, which makes them good sacrifice fodder.\n",
    "barbarian": "Barbarian\nBarbarians are strong melee fighters who start the game with poison resistance. Because barbarians can fight their way through situations that would kill other players, and because they need not worry about poison, they are one of the easier roles for a new player. When a barbarian starts the game with a dog, the dog is always named Idefix, assuming naming options are unchanged. The barbarian's attack messages replace most instances of \"hit\" with \"smite\" (e.g. \"You smite the foo!\"), but this is flavor text with no gameplay effect.\nBarbarians can be either neutral or chaotic, and can be either humans or orcs. Their first sacrifice gift is Cleaver. According to the guidebook:\nEach barbarian starts with the following:\nBULLET::::- Either of these cases (50% chance each):\nBULLET::::- a +0 two-handed sword and a +0 axe\nBULLET::::- a +0 battle-axe and a +0 short sword (orcish short sword for orcs)\nBULLET::::- a +0 ring mail (orcish ring mail for orcs)\nBULLET::::- a food ration (with the usual chance of getting a stack of 2)\nBULLET::::- if an orc, two more random food-class items (each of which also may be a stack of 2)\nBULLET::::- an oil lamp ( chance)\nBarbarians gain intrinsics at these experience levels:\nBULLET::::- Level 1: poison resistance\nBULLET::::- Level 7: speed\nBULLET::::- Level 15: stealth\nBarbarians start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Axe\", \"Bare hands\", and the skill for their sword (short or two-handed).\nMost Barbarians should seek out Cleaver, an artifact battle-axe and their first sacrifice gift, as soon as possible. Cleaver's ability to slice through multiple foes as of 3.6.1 will provide a well-needed early boon for dealing with early groups, such as giant ants and hill orc hordes of enemies.\nThe starting ring mail should be replaced with any other metal armor, preferably an an elven or dwarvish mithril-coat. The barbarian's combat capabilities make the Gnomish Mines a viable choice to visit early, as they are likely to come across dwarven armor to pet test.\nWhile barbarians overall should have no trouble dishing out damage, players should be wary not to lean too much on their health and armor to carry them through every fight. The intrinsic poison resistance that barbarians start with widens the list of edible corpses that can be eaten in lieu of permafood. Orcish barbarians find the poison resistance redundant, but will appreciate the additional lack of penalties for cannibalism, and infravision for the Gnomish Mines. For chaotics, orcish barbarians will also have an easier time converting early altars than their human counterparts due to the earlier presence of same-race monsters; human barbarians can still make use of werecreature corpses, but will have to contend with them calling for help and potentially catching lycanthropy from bites.\nThe barbarian quest is not especially difficult, though there are some significant wrinkles. While the monster generation is biased towards ogres, it may also contain a very large number of trolls, which can be the biggest hazard for an underleveled or under-prepared barbarian. If enough trolls are present, they can form an almost perpetual swarm around the player as they rise from the dead faster than they can be permanently disposed of. A tinning kit can be extremely helpful in this situation, as can a wielded footrice corpse; a corpse-eating pet is another option. As a last resort, you can lure one or two trolls at a time from Thoth Amon's lair to the previous level and dispatch them there. This gets the trolls off your back and eventually leaves you free to kill all the ogres and Thoth Amon.\nThere is also the notable lack of incentive presented by the quest artifact: The Heart of Ahriman, infamously regarded as one of the most useless quest artifacts. Its base item is a luckstone, but another luckstone is guaranteed at Mines' End; it provides stealth for a class that obtains the intrinsic at XL 15 (one level after the quest even becomes an option). Barbarians can #invoke it for levitation, but this particularly quirky method is only slightly preferable to the potion of levitation, and much less desirable than that provided by other means, such as a ring of levitation - however, it does let you ride a non-flying steed.\nTrolls and ogres are eligible for high level offensive items, such as the wand of lightning or the wand of death. Careful players will want to postpone the quest until after obtaining magic resistance or reflection.\nSince the Bell of Opening is required for the Invocation, a player may be inclined to leave the quest until later on and retrieve the Bell once they are otherwise ready to perform it; on the other hand, the Bell is also a viable alternative if they are lacking a silver weapon, such as a silver spear or silver saber, for the shades in Orcus-town.\nCleaver becomes a risky weapon to carry into the lowest floors and beyond, since if it becomes cursed, it will leave you with no hands free to get it uncursed. Prayer is a workable strategy in the upper dungeon, but this is no longer available in Gehennom, and the pace of the endgame is too hectic to rely on being able to pray. Genociding liches and keeping Cleaver blessed will greatly reduce the danger of it becoming cursed. A solution is to sacrifice for more gifts until you receive a good artifact weapon such as Frost Brand, Stormbringer, or Vorpal Blade and twoweapon it with a silver spear or silver saber.\nBarbarians have the highest spellcasting penalty in the game. Without a robe, it is impossible for them to cast any spell other than their special spell, haste self, at lower than 66% fail (67% without helm of brilliance). Even haste self will cap at 30% fail (34% without helm of brilliance). Spellcasting is essentially out of the question until the Barbarian can manage to find a robe, but once they locate one they might be able to make use of some low level non-combat spells. As of 3.6.2, barbarians can advance to Basic in escape spells, making the spell of haste self more viable to learn.\nNeutral barbarians who are not averse to wishing for quest artifacts may find The Orb of Fate a worthwhile use of a wish. The Orb provides valuable enhancements to a combat-reliant character, confering half physical damage and half spell damage, as well as doing a number of other useful things. It is, in short, everything that the Heart of Ahriman isn't (including \"very\" heavy\u2014a significant downside factor). Chaotic barbarians, on the other hand, would likely prefer The Master Key of Thievery due to its half physical damage and other effects, though it unfortunately does not offer the half spell damage that the Orb does.\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1\u20132: Plunderer/Plunderess\nBULLET::::- XL 3\u20135: Pillager\nBULLET::::- XL 6\u20139: Bandit\nBULLET::::- XL 10\u201313: Brigand\nBULLET::::- XL 14\u201317: Raider\nBULLET::::- XL 18\u201321: Reaver\nBULLET::::- XL 22\u201325: Slayer\nBULLET::::- XL 26\u201329: Chieftain/Chieftainess\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Conqueror/Conqueress\nBarbarians can expect to be overcharged in SLASH'EM's shops, by a factor of 3. This, combined with barbarians' low charisma, makes many items (in particular the now 1000zm base-cost magic lamp) nigh-unaffordable, forcing barbarians to resort to other means, such as their second sacrifice gift (see below).\nIn addition to Cleaver, barbarians get Deathsword as their second sacrifice gift; it is a chaotic two-handed sword with +5 to hit and +14 to damage against humans. This can be useful for murdering shopkeepers and aligned priests, it can also be useful against werecreatures and for cleaning out barracks. Other significant targets are Thoth Amon, the Wizard of Yendor, and the high priest of Moloch as well as his attendant aligned priests. Since it is such a specialty weapon, you won't likely want to waste any skill points on two-handed sword.\nUnfortunately, the fact is that barbarians' first two guaranteed sacrifice gifts both become outclassed by SLASH'EM's mid-game, and approach obsolescence by its endgame. A barbarian can either expect to have more of a challenge fighting monsters, to do a lot of sacrificing, to spend a wish or two, or to be crowned to get Stormbringer or Vorpal Blade, which are both respectable weapons in SLASH'EM\u2014Vorpal Blade has had its chance of beheading doubled to 10%. It goes without saying that many spoiled chaotic barbarians will try for the infamous Bat from Hell, but the old favorites from vanilla remain good choices.\nSpears are much more common in SLASH'EM, making them a more viable distance weapon if you don't mind the weight, which barbarians should be able to carry.\nA droven barbarian is an easy race-role combination for SLASH'EM players. At the start of the game, a droven barbarian should immediately unwield the weapon () and fight bare-handed. This gains access to the drow's \"very useful\" melee sleep attack, an immense help for the difficult melee environment at the start of SLASH'EM. The ability to repeatedly put your opponent to sleep should compensate for bare hands doing less damage than good weapons! To train your axe skill, wield your axe or battle-axe against monsters with sleep resistance. Eventually, you will be fighting primarily with Cleaver, alternating to bare-handed only when you need it. Drow cannot two-weapon, but fighting bare-handed should more than offset that.\nIn UnNetHack, the Heart of Ahriman gives its owner displacement instead of stealth. Considering that Barbarians acquire intrinsic stealth at level 15, this makes the Heart a more desirable acquisition. \nIn addition to Human and Orc, UnNetHack also offers Vampire as a starting race for Barbarians.\nThe Heart of Ahriman now grants MR, reflection, half-spell damage, drain resistance, fire resistance and poison resistance while carried, and #invokes for blessed remove curse. This makes uncursing your weapon a tad easier, so barbarians can possibly wield Cleaver late in the game.\n",
    "ranger": "Ranger\nThe ranger is one of the player roles in NetHack. Rangers can be either neutral or chaotic, and can be humans, elves, gnomes, or orcs.\nRangers can get expert in dagger, sling, dart, boomerang, spear, bow and crossbow, and also in divination spells. Rangers cannot use two-weapon combat.\nThe guidebook entry for the ranger has this to say about them:\nBULLET::::- +1 dagger\nBULLET::::- +1 bow or +1 crossbow\nBULLET::::- 50-59 +2 arrows or crossbow bolts\nBULLET::::- 30-39 +0 arrows or crossbow bolts\nBULLET::::- +2 cloak of displacement (or +2 elven cloak for elven rangers)\nBULLET::::- 4-8 cram rations\nElven and orcish rangers start with racial equipment (elven dagger or orcish dagger instead of dagger, etc.). Elves get an elven cloak instead of a cloak of displacement and lembas wafers in the place of cram rations. Orcish rangers get orcish bow and orcish arrows but still get a cloak of displacement. Chaotic rangers also have a 1% chance of their starting arrow stacks being generated poisoned. Gnomish rangers start with a crossbow and crossbow bolts instead of a bow and arrows.\nBecause elven rangers begin with an elven dagger, they are able to create Sting immediately, with all the advantages and disadvantages that entails.\nBULLET::::- Exp Level 1: searching\nBULLET::::- Exp Level 7: stealth\nBULLET::::- Exp Level 15: see invisible\nRangers start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Dagger\" and the category of their starting launcher (either \"Bow\" or \"Crossbow\").\nRangers have a role bonus for multishot which applies to stackable ranged weapons \"except\" daggers. Skill and racial bonuses apply as normal.\nIf you're not a gnome, the Mines will be fairly dangerous. However the resident gnomes and dwarves will have plenty of ranged weapons and armor that you might want. It will be hard to attack enemies from a distance on dark levels, especially for players without infravision.\nIt is important to remember that enchanted arrows and arrows which have been blessed break less often than other arrows. Luck plays a factor as well so a blessed luckstone is essential for long term arrow use. (With maximum luck and blessed arrows enchanted to +2 or higher, arrows break only very rarely.) This makes Mine's End a hazardous but very important destination. This also makes obtaining holy water a high priority.\nAccumulate a stack of daggers to save your arrows from breaking. You can discard these after you have a large stack of blessed, +6 or +7 arrows.\nUse your +2 arrows first; not only do they do more damage, but they are less likely to break. Note that while arrows are made of metal (which can corrode), elven arrows are made of wood, so regardless of strategy, it's a good idea to keep a few elven arrows to dispatch acidic monsters and rust monsters. Elven rangers have the advantage of having such arrows from the start of the game.\nConsider poisoning your arrows by dipping them in a potion of sickness. This will cause d6 damage and will instantly kill 10% of the time if your target is not poison resistant. Some will become unpoisoned, however, giving you two stacks of arrows, some poisoned and some not. Use the unpoisoned arrows when attacking targets which are not vulnerable to poison. When you intend to enchant your arrows further (or most of your arrows have become unpoisoned), poison the unpoisoned arrows and put them back into the quiver. Note that getting potions of sickness is not difficult; 1/4 of random alchemy results become sickness, so dipping a couple of random potions together should get you a potion of sickness.\nYou can acquire more arrows from dead bodies or by untrapping arrow traps.\nKeep in mind that Rangers can throw or fire up to 4 ranged weapons at once (except for daggers) giving them on an average 2.5 times the damage as the same weapon in melee. Unskilled or Basic skill can randomly hurl up to 1 extra weapon, 2 extra for Skilled and 3 for Expert. See multishot for details.\nRangers are extremely unlikely to cast spells in the early game, so metallic armor is fine.\nA good strategy is to maintain a distance from opponents: most monsters are much poorer at ranged combat than a starting Ranger. Humans, Gnomes and Orcs start with a cloak of displacement which helps with this strategy.\nElbereth can't be kept from smudging: Levitating while firing your arrows or daggers will make you fire only one missile. Also, you are paralyzed when you hurtle in the opposite direction from your shot; this lasts at least as long as you would take walking, so this is a dangerous way to run away.\nThe Quest is a bit tough, and the reward is not too great. The Longbow of Diana provides reflection, but you will want an alternate source of reflection before going on the Quest anyway, to defend against the large number of centaurs armed with wands. However, it does provide telepathy when carried in open inventory and gives the Wizard something else to steal (a quest artifact) other than the Amulet of Yendor.\nYou can get several hundred arrows from the first level of the Ranger quest off of dead centaurs and untrapping the two arrow traps before the quest boss' lair. Also, the Ranger quest artifact, The Longbow of Diana, can be invoked to summon arrows of its corresponding blessed/cursed status.\nHuman Rangers should consider switching to darts as their primary ranged weapon. They are as lightweight and plentiful as arrows, don't require a wielded launcher, and despite their low base damage benefit from high Strength, unlike arrows or bolts: at Strength of 18 darts do as much damage as elven arrows, and with human maximum of 18/** each dart will deal additional 4 damage over that. The only downside is a lack of silver damage.\nFor other races it's a less viable strategy, however, both due to lower Strength cap and race-specific multishot bonuses. Gauntlets of Power may somewhat mitigate this problem however.\nWishing for Magicbane (even if you're not neutral) is a good idea because daggers are one of the few weapons Rangers can get expert in. Non-cursed athames (including Magicbane) may also be used to engrave Elbereth on the ground without dulling the blade. In addition to decent damage, it also dispenses useful magical effects on opponents (cancel, probe, stun, and scare).\nGetting an artifact from your god will unrestrict the associated weapon skill. If you cannot wish or sacrifice for artifacts then spears, tridents and crysknives are all within the Rangers' skillset. You can deal significantly more damage by firing arrows in point-blank range, though.\nBe careful around water: you don't want your +7 elven arrows to fall in!\nShould you require extra AC, a small shield gives +1 AC and doesn't impede your Divination spells too much once you've trained. A shield of reflection can also be useful for its extrinsic, opening up your amulet slot for life-saving (or ESP, but ESP is granted by your quest artifact). Rangers cannot two-weapon, and probably should not be using two-handed weapons at this stage of the game.\nA robe will likely be helpful for spellcasting.\nOnce you have blessed your arrows and have holy water to spare, you can start blessing spellbooks and learning some of the divination spells. A good spell to practice with is light as it's easy to cast and does not take up a lot of power.\nBecause so many things need to be enchanted (e.g., melee weapon(s), arrows, silver arrows, silver dagger/spear etc), scrolls of enchant weapon are at a premium. Consider putting magic markers and wands of polymorph high on your list of priorities. (Enchanting bows is usually a waste; it only helps your to-hit calculations, not damage, and most players hit every round anyway by the time they get around to enchanting things.)\nRaising your experience level past 15 may be useful for spellcasting, but otherwise it's probably not worth the trouble. Power can be raised with scrolls of charging, and HP can be raised through alchemy and nurse-dancing.\nYou will really want a good melee weapon because you will likely be levitating a lot in the endgame. That makes it dangerous to fire projectiles.\nHaving a silver backup weapon such as a silver dagger or silver spear is a good idea. While Rangers can't use silver sabers without penalty (unless they are gifted Werebane by their god, unrestricting it), silver daggers and spears can be thrown at incoming silver vulnerable creatures to soften them up. Silver arrows are precious and should be used only on especially nasty creatures; however, blessed silver arrows enchanted to +2 will last you a long time if you have high luck.\nRemember that range is your best friend. Nasties on the upstair? Get just close enough, your maximum range, and fire away. They will not flee upstairs as you are too far away, they will not summon monsters at that range and they will not attack you.\nMost of the spells Rangers will cast are not useful in battle, so a shield of reflection or elven shield might be useful additions to your ascension kit.\nRangers can become powerful spellcasters at this stage, particularly with divination spells. Although other types won't be as easy to cast, divination has a lot to offer. Some of the best spells in the game are magic mapping, identify and . Among the non-divination spells, is useful on the Astral Plane as well as to keep a distance from foes. Healing may be useful if you have a pet.\nBelow is a table of all possible spells a Ranger can get at least Basic at.\n! Skill !! Spells\nBasic, , , , stone to flesh, , , , , , teleport away\nExpertdetect monsters, , detect food, , , , , \nRangers use intelligence as their spellcasting stat.\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1-2: Tenderfoot\nBULLET::::- XL 3-5: Lookout\nBULLET::::- XL 6-9: Trailblazer\nBULLET::::- XL 10-13: Reconnoiterer/Reconnoiteress\nBULLET::::- XL 14-17: Scout\nBULLET::::- XL 18-21: Arbalester\nBULLET::::- XL 22-25: Archer\nBULLET::::- XL 26-29: Sharpshooter\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Marksman/Markswoman\nThe quest sees you fighting for The Longbow of Diana, the artifact bow that creates arrows when invoked and grants ESP when carried. It also provides reflection when wielded.\nThe Ranger quest is arguably one of the harder ones since centaurs are very fast and use projectiles. In addition to that, all of the quest levels are full of traps.\nIt is advised to have speed boots when going on the quest so that the centaurs don't hit you as much per turn. Be sure to also have reflection (centaurs are intelligent enough to use wands), having magic resistance also helps a whole lot.\nThe quest is full of items, however. You will probably find lots of scrolls and plenty of potions as well.\nThe easiest way to fight centaurs is using ranged attacks. Poisoned arrows work extremely well, even unenchanted ones. Keep your distance away from enemies, only switching to your melee weapon when fighting wimpy monsters (such as scorpions or bats).\nOnce in Scorpius' cavern, checking the maximum range you can fire, get that distance from the upstair and wound and wake him up. A good spray of +2 arrows will finish him off after he teleports to the stairs. If he attacks you, be sure to remember to cure the sickness!\nSee Ranger(SLASH'EM)\nIn Unnethack, rangers are restricted to skilled in spear.\n",
    "knight": "Knight\nThe Knight is one of the player roles in NetHack. Knights are always lawful humans. According to the guidebook:\nBULLET::::- +1 long sword\nBULLET::::- +1 lance\nBULLET::::- +1 ring mail\nBULLET::::- +0 helmet\nBULLET::::- +0 small shield\nBULLET::::- +0 leather gloves\nBULLET::::- 10 to 20 uncursed apples\nBULLET::::- 10 to 20 uncursed carrots\nThe starting pet is always a pony with a saddle.\nKnights can identify all weapons and non-magical armor from the beginning.

The quest nemesis is a dragon called Ixoth. He is a rather tough opponent, although he can be dealt with by using Elbereth or paralysis. Knights receive the Magic Mirror of Merlin after the quest, which allows them to become powerful spellcasters.\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1\u20132: Gallant\nBULLET::::- XL 3\u20135: Esquire\nBULLET::::- XL 6\u20139: Bachelor\nBULLET::::- XL 10\u201313: Sergeant\nBULLET::::- XL 14\u201317: Knight\nBULLET::::- XL 18\u201321: Banneret\nBULLET::::- XL 22\u201325: Chevalier/Chevaliere\nBULLET::::- XL 26\u201329: Seignieur/Dame\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Paladin\nThere are special rules of conduct for a Knight:\n\"You caitiff!\"\nKnights take a \u22121 alignment penalty for attacking sleeping, paralyzed, or fleeing monsters (even if the monster continues to attack while fleeing) except when the monster just stole something. Monsters getting dressed (e.g., \"the soldier puts on a crested helmet\") are considered paralyzed.\nThe alignment penalty occurs each turn you attack when the monster is still sleeping, paralyzed, or fleeing.\nIf the monster is a weak one then it is a good idea to dismount and let your horse finish it; your horse will get an additional HP.\nKnights also suffer this alignment penalty for using a poisoned weapon (e.g. a poisoned dart or arrow) in combat.\nIf you use spells, your alignment record will be unaffected.\n\"You feel like a glutton!\"\nThere is a \u22121 alignment penalty for eating while satiated.\n\"You feel like a common thief.\"\nThere is a \u22121 alignment penalty for digging down in a shop. This does not apply if the shopkeeper has been killed.\nKnights can jump to get out of trouble. It costs some nutrition, but can provide an extra opportunity to engrave Elbereth, or to find some stairs. Many Knights perish when they forget about this ability.\nOne good strategy is to feed your horse 9 of your starting apples as soon as it drops an item. This will increase its tameness to the point where you will be able to mount it without slipping. Feeding it after it drops an item will also increase its apport. As the game progresses, keep in mind that many things can cause a mount attempt to fail causing you to lose 10\u201314 HP. Thus it is a bad idea to attempt a mount with fewer than 15 HP. You want your pony to kill some things to build more hit points and grow into a faster mount, and it is less likely to kill a monster while you are riding it. If you find a harmless monster like a yellow mold or a lichen, then dismount and let your pony dispatch it. If the sum of your mount's tameness and your XL is greater than or equal to 20, you will not slip when you remount unless there is something else causing a problem (e.g., rusted body armor).\nIf your horse has been repeatedly hit and you are mounted, flee. If you aren't mounted but you have a magic whistle, use it to get your horse out of danger. Obtain a stethoscope as soon as possible. If your horse is low on hit points then look for a safe place (telepathy is great for checking if there are no monsters around), remove your armor and cast healing spells on it (direction is \"\" if you are riding it). If you are riding, your mount will not attack peaceful monsters such as watch captains or shopkeepers that might out-match your steed.\nAs you descend below Mine Town or below DL 7, polymorph traps become a concern. If you have magic resistance, it will protect both you and your pet from transformation. A ring of polymorph control will protect you, but will not protect your pet from being changed into a random monster that will likely not take a saddle.\nBecause pets feed mostly on the corpses of fallen monsters and few of them are vegetable, horses are harder to keep fed than other pets. One of the two primary sources of food for a horse is the food the knight gets in his initial equipment. Any vegetarian food will keep a horse fed for 4\u20135 times as long as it would keep you fed, with exceptions for starving pets. For that reason, do \"not\" eat carrots and apples except in an emergency; for example, being blinded in a dangerous situation, which can be remedied by eating a carrot. Lack of people food is usually not an emergency. Find other sources of food or wait until you become weak and then pray. Carrots and apples can be used to reward a horse who has stolen an item from a shop, encouraging it to steal more items, with no alignment record penalty.\nThe other primary source of food for horses is corpses from creatures like lichens and molds (except yellow molds).\nMonitor your horse's hunger status by chatting to it regularly. It is not necessary to dismount to chat with your horse, just chat in the down direction (\"\"). If it \"whickers,\" it is fine, but if it \"whinnies,\" it is hungry. If it ever comes close to starvation (\"you feel worried about your horse\" or \"your horse is confused from hunger\"), it will also accept \"people food\" such as food rations. You should heal a starving horse as soon as possible after feeding it; a starving horse has its maximum HP reduced to one quarter of its original. While feeding it restores its maximum HP, the horse will still have to heal its current HP from the one-quarter level.\nTaming another horse by throwing it an apple is tempting but the food problem will become even more acute. Taming a third horse is definitely unwise.\nThe easiest way of keeping your horse fed is to let it go feral. When it whinnies, go upstairs. Wait there for some 200 turns (if you want to be completely sure, wait 500 turns instead). Go back downstairs, and your horse will be feral, hopefully (but that's not required) peaceful. Throw anything your horse will eat at it and it will be a satiated new pet. NetHack doesn't keep track of your former pet's nutrition.\nThe Knight's pony starts with a saddle. If your saddle becomes cursed and you aren't riding you will be unable to mount your horse, and if you are riding then you can't dismount. Reading a spell of remove curse or zapping a wand of cancellation downwards doesn't work. If it is safe to do so, praying to your god may dismount you. Zapping a wand of opening or casting knock downward will throw you from your mount and remove the saddle. Nymphs and foocubi can steal a cursed saddle from your mount, even while you are riding it. Wearing a ring of conflict may also cause your mount to throw you from the saddle, though this leaves the saddle attached to your mount.\nOnce you have potions of holy water to spare it is a good idea to use one of them to bless your saddle. It is best to use your lance and speed to keep monsters that curse from ever coming in contact with you. Your saddle's worst nemesis is black dragons. By the time you meet one of them you will probably be immune to disintegration, but your mount won't be (unless it has reflection), and the saddle will suffer its fate. Saddles are nearly as difficult to replace as lances. It is usually a good idea to quickly close with black dragons while avoiding being directly in line with them, joust them and then finish them before they recover.\nThe Knight requires special tactics to be successful. If it is a full moon, Knights can start using the lance from the start. Otherwise, Knights should wait until they have positive luck to start jousting. With positive Luck, Knights should apply the lance at range, and then attempt to joust when the monster closes to melee range. Using this tactic with expert lance skill on a very fast mount, it is possible to deal with Minotaurs, dragons and high-level demons without losing a single hit point.\nSince in the weapon charts the lance seems to do less damage than the long sword and there is no lance artifact weapon, people playing Knights tend to discard the lance and rely on the long sword. However, when you account for the effects of jousting the lance causes considerably more damage than a regular long sword, and even compares favorably with Excalibur.\nAgainst a normal-sized opponent the long sword does 1d8 damage (average 4.5), while the lance causes 1d6 damage (3.5 on average) plus an additional 2d10 damage when jousting (11 on average). Thus, including skill bonuses, at Unskilled level the average damage is 3.5\u00a0+ 11\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.2\u00a0\u2212 2 =\u00a03.7, at Basic 7.9, at Skilled 11.1 and at Expert it is 14.3. By comparison, Excalibur at Expert skill does 1d8+1d10+2 HP of damage for an average of 12. Against a large opponent, after factoring in jousting and skill bonuses the lance inflicts on average 4.7 HP damage at Unskilled level of expertise, 8.9 at Basic, 12.1 at Skilled and 15.3 at Expert. Excalibur does on average only 14 HP (at expert skill) against large opponents. It is true that Excalibur gets a +5 to hit bonus, but this is irrelevant for high level characters with enchanted weapons and Expert level of expertise, since they hit every round anyway.\nIn addition, the lance allows attacking non-adjacent opponents (pounding), and a successful joust pushes the opponent one square away (possibly for another round of pounding) and stuns it. In fact, an unencumbered Knight on a fast mount with a lance is possibly the only character who can kill Demogorgon in melee combat without resorting to tricks like Elbereth or polymorphing; on a successful joust he will not be able to attack a second time or teleport before the Knight finishes him. At high skill levels the lance is ideal for dealing with situations where you find yourself surrounded by one layer of monsters: every joust (and you will be getting a lot of them) will push a monster one square away, meaning there is one less monster who will attack you this round and possibly allowing you to slip away. At base skill levels you will rarely succeed in jousting, so if foes get next to you, jump away. As an aside: you don't get paralyzed when you apply your lance on a floating eye.\nEven if you use the lance as your primary weapon, it is still worth keeping Excalibur. Lances occasionally break, and Excalibur confers incidental attributes such as level drain resistance. In addition, Excalibur exhibits less variance in damage compared to the highly variable damage inflicted by jousting. Excalibur twoweaponed with another highly enchanted weapon can also do more damage than a lance.\nTo make full use of your lance you need two things: light and speed. You will be unable to apply your lance if you cannot see your foe. Detecting it by telepathy doesn't work, so having a light source is important.\nLances can break and are difficult to replace. If your luck is positive, the probability of it breaking is very low. If it is not a full moon, you should use the lance only for pounding (not for close combat) until you can increase your luck. Once you get to Expert skill level with the lance there is no point in using it on weak monsters; shift to the sword to avoid breaking your lance. Until you can get it rustproofed (or at least covered with grease) don't wield it in places likely to have rust traps (e.g. most levels of the Gnomish Mines), unless you have a supply of potions of oil. Soldiers are sometimes generated with lances in their inventory, making Fort Ludios and the Castle a perfect place to look for a replacement or spare lance.\nYour mount's speed is very important for a Knight. If you are faster than your opponent and you joust it, it will be unable to hit back. In this way, you can attack a monster without it ever being able to attack. Being encumbered slows you down and bars you from jumping. Fight while encumbered is a significant disadvantage; drop everything you don't need to have on hand for a combat as soon as you see a monster. At 7th level \"you\" will become fast, but this makes little difference if you are riding. Your pony will get faster when it grows into a horse, and your horse will get faster still when it grows into a warhorse.\nMonsters will detect you only if they move adjacent, but if you stay at a distance of two squares you will remain undetected (even if carrying a light!) and they will move aimlessly while you apply your lance on them again and again until they are killed.\nBecause they don't have carnivorous pets eating any egg they can find, Knights have a higher chance than other roles to get dragon eggs and, once they hatch, a tame dragon as a pet. Dragons can be saddled and ridden and thus are more useful to Knights than to most other classes.\nOnce acquired a dragon must be grown. It will gain 1d(victim\u00a0level\u00a0+ 1) HP every time it kills a monster. It will increase its level by one for every 8 HP gained. Therefore once the egg is hatched you should go to lower dungeon levels and avoid killing monsters but let the dragon do it (dismount if you are riding it).\nWhen growing your dragon, you should note:\nBULLET::::- A mounted pet will attack any monster whatever his level when the monster's attack goes astray and falls on the pet instead of you\nBULLET::::- An unmounted pet will attack any monster on its own initiative, provided that the monster's level is not two or more above that of the pet. Also, monsters don't attack unmounted pets unless attacked first.\nBULLET::::- When riding you get better control of your pet's whereabouts, what it is engaging and when. Nothing is more frustrating than having a dragon get killed because it engaged the Oracle or the watch captain at a moment when it was low on HP.\nBULLET::::- Because your mount is only targeted by \"stray attacks\", the danger of it getting killed is less when mounted than when dismounted where it will have to fight monsters alone without your assistance and getting the full share of their blows.\nBULLET::::- If you are riding there will be almost no chance of you becoming separated (e.g. due to a trap door or a level teleport trap) from your mount.\nYou have to decide if you will change mounts from horse to dragon.\nPros:\nBULLET::::- Dragons can reach level 22 and 176 HP\nBULLET::::- They have the same immunities (poison, disintegration, electricity) as other dragons of the same species.\nBULLET::::- Dragons can fly, allowing the Knight to cross obstacles impassable to horses. Also, burdened Knights no longer need to dismount before going downstairs.\nBULLET::::- They are carnivorous and thus easier to keep fed. (This also means that they will gladly eat up any safe fleshy corpse you ride over unless they're already eating).\nCons:\nBULLET::::- Dragons are quite slow compared to horses (and especially warhorses), so when mounted you will travel at its speed. Indeed it is faster to walk while being intrinsically fast. Make sure to zap it with a wand of speed monster to improve this somewhat.\nBULLET::::- You will also have to decide what to do with your horse. It may steal kills from your much slower dragon, preventing its growth.\nAn excellent option for a Knight is a ki-rin, giving you the best of both worlds; ki-rin are fast, fly, don't eat, and will heal themselves. As Knights do not decrease tameness when they mount something, they do not have the problem other classes have of keeping the ki-rin tame. Furthermore, ki-rin will resist conflict (unless level drained), so they will not buck you while you are riding. The hard part is to get a tame ki-rin; they're rare and have a high magic resistance; that makes them hard to tame even if you do find one, and your best bet of getting a tame ki-rin is to spend a wish on a blessed figurine of one. Beware of letting your ki-rin attack fire elementals on the Plane of Fire. You will probably need to find a way to let it heal on the Astral Plane.\nIn UnNetHack, a Knight can also be a lawful dwarf. Knights carrying any body armor heavier than studded leather armor receive a weight reduction for it equal to half the difference; this allows them to carry more while wearing heavy armor before becoming burdened.\nSee Knight/SLASH'EM.\n",
    "monk": "Monk\nThe Monk is one of the player roles in \"NetHack\". Monks are always human, and can be lawful, neutral, or chaotic. They are martial artists conforming to the \"Shaolin Monk\" stereotype. From the guidebook:\nThe Monk is a good choice for a player who wants to practice both magic and hand-to-hand combat, but isn't interested in using weapons. It is a good class with which to achieve conducts.\nMonks know all nonmagical armors from the start. Their special spell is . When crowned, they get a spellbook of restore ability instead of the standard crowning sword.\nBULLET::::- +2 leather gloves\nBULLET::::- +1 robe\nBULLET::::- a blessed spellbook (equal chance of , or )\nBULLET::::- a random scroll (not enchant weapon)\nBULLET::::- 3 potions of healing (possibly blessed)\nBULLET::::- 3 to 6 uncursed food rations\nBULLET::::- 5 to 10 apples\nBULLET::::- 5 to 10 oranges\nBULLET::::- 3 to 6 fortune cookies\nBULLET::::- 20% chance of an uncursed magic marker\nBULLET::::- otherwise, 10% chance of an oil lamp\nMonks gain intrinsics at these experience levels:\nBULLET::::- XL 1: see invisible, sleep resistance, and speed\nBULLET::::- XL 3: poison resistance\nBULLET::::- XL 5: stealth\nBULLET::::- XL 7: warning\nBULLET::::- XL 9: automatic searching\nBULLET::::- XL 11: fire resistance\nBULLET::::- XL 13: cold resistance\nBULLET::::- XL 15: shock resistance\nBULLET::::- XL 17: teleport control\nIn essence, Monks automatically acquire all of the intrinsics granted by crowning (and then some) by the time they reach level 17. \nMonks start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Martial arts\" and \"Healing spells\". The initial spellcasting skills are hardcoded in the function skill_init in , so even Monks starting with other spellbooks than healing start unskilled in \"Clerical\" or \"Enchantment\", but still basic skilled in \"Healing\".\nThe things that make a Monk unique are the penalties imposed for non-Monkish behavior:\nMonks feel guilty about eating non-vegetarian food, and suffer a small alignment penalty (-1 alignment) for doing so. As compensation for this, they gain intrinsics rapidly as they level up. The penalty can be considered a fair price for getting otherwise tricky to find intrinsics, such as telepathy or disintegration resistance. Because of these intrisics, many players who want to play a vegetarian, vegan, or foodless character choose Monk. However, in general Monks should not feel required to maintain the vegetarian conduct. Unless they eat enough meat to make their alignment negative they shouldn't have any problems. This also provides an additional easy way for Monks to keep their alignment low enough to avoid crowning.\nMonks are penalized for wearing body armor (all armors and mails; this doesn't include robes, cloaks and shirts) with a -20 to-hit penalty. Other types of armor (boots, gloves, and helms) carry no penalty. For a low-level Monk it is virtually impossible to hit while wearing body armor. However, some players start using body armor once they have reached a high experience level with enough dexterity, strength and luck to overcome the to-hit penalty. The armor penalty doesn't apply if you are polymorphed, so a Monk that gets his hands on a ring of polymorph control can turn into, say, a vampire lord and have no problem hitting while wearing armor.\nMonks get additional hit bonus when not wearing a body armor nor a shield and not wielding a weapon. This bonus is experience level / 3 + 2.\nWearing a shield or body armor makes a Monk incapable of dealing a \"staggering blow\", reducing his or her effectiveness in martial arts.\nMonks are pretty capable fighters in the early game. Martial arts do good enough damage, and the Monk's starting inventory is just fine. Many of the weapons and armor lying around in the early game are of little use. It is probably best to focus on learning spells and gaining protection.\nIt is very likely that an amulet of reflection will be your source of reflection for the entire game, so heading to Sokoban early is a good idea.\nMonks can often get through the early game (or the entire game) with no weapons at all. If you really feel you need a ranged weapon, crossbows are plentiful in the Mines but wielding one is a hazard to any weaponless attempt. Shuriken are good if you can find some, but are subject to breakage. A small stack of spears, although heavy, is normally easily obtainable.\nA Monk is probably the best role for attempting a weaponless conduct, since they can train up to Grand Master in martial arts. Indeed, at early stages of the games, hands are the best \"weapon\" for a Monk. There is no actual penalty for using weapons, but Monks can attain proficiency in very few weapon skills.\nThe 20 points to-hit penalty for wearing body armor is huge. This makes body armor entirely infeasible, except for pacifists. You should find a good helm and shoes, even if they are metallic. Keep your robe safe: it massively boosts your spellcasting and will be hard to replace early on.\nAt the early stages of the game, it is not recommended to use a shield, as you lose your hit bonus for not wearing a shield or weapon, and it will additionally harm your spellcasting. \nAll of the three possible starting spells are useful if used in conjuction with martial arts. Healing lets you fight longer, sleep prevents your enemies from fighting back, and protection can make up for armor deficiencies (if you cast it before going into your fights).\nMonk is the only role other than Wizard that can achieve at least a Basic proficiency in every magical school. This broad array of possible spells is useful for any Monk, but especially for one attempting a weaponless conduct.\nThe starting robe gives Monks a massive bonus to spellcasting as well, twice what any other role gets from wearing one. Even taking into account base spellcasting penalties, a Monk with a robe will still enjoy a better total bonus than even a Wizard.\nMonks do not have the hungerless spellcasting available to Wizards, so wearing a ring of slow digestion is especially useful.\nMaximize your Luck as soon as possible once you get a luckstone. Once you have maximized your luck and have a good experience level, start trying on body armor to see if you can hit consistently. If you can, a lot of the problems surrounding armor will be resolved.\nMonks have one of the toughest quests in \"NetHack\". Master Kaen is legendarily difficult, and because he is a spellcaster you will want magic resistance before you meet him. Be sure to read up on his weaknesses. The phasing monsters on the Quest can swarm around you no matter where you hide. Combining all that with your difficult armor choices makes it likely that you will need to wait until after completing the Castle to embark on the Quest. (In 3.6.0, Kaen is vulnerable to the effects of a scroll of scare monster, making the fight with him much easier, so finishing the Castle shouldn't be necessary.)\nAssembling an ascension kit can be a bit of a puzzle, seeing as you will likely avoid body armor and shields. Your alignment becomes very important once you start wishing for artifacts.\nIf you decide to wish for artifacts, try to obtain magic resistance first (slotless if possible), and then half damage if you can get some. There are no lawful half physical damage artifacts, an important consideration given a Monk's AC challenges. Neutrals can get the weighty Orb of Fate for this, but for a spellcaster, the energy regeneration and branchporting of the Eye of the Aethiopica might be better. Neutrals can also sacrifice for Magicbane to get magic resistance and unrestrict dagger skill as a bonus. Chaotic Monks can get half physical damage via the Master Key of Thievery.\nTypically, the other weapon worth using is a good, well enchanted artifact weapon. Otherwise, bare handed attacks will be more effective due to being restricted in almost every weapon skill. To unlock a skill, you need to obtain a weapon of the same skill by sacrificing or by crowning.\nYou should always wear a shield if you are wielding a weapon, as there is no additional penalty for using both a weapon and a shield. Since shields harm spellcasting, wear either a small shield, which is not that bad, or a shield of reflection, whose benefit of reflection is worth the spellcasting penalty.\nAs for body armor, some players do not wear body armor at all. Most players do wear body armor during the middle or late game, as it solves a lot of problems.\nIt is very important to lower your AC by all means. Another problem is obtaining magic resistance and magic cancellation. If you cannot hit anything while wearing body armor, and cannot get an artifact offering magic resistance, you might need to forego your robe in favor of a cloak of magic resistance.\nIf you have no magic resistance, polymorph traps will be a serious problem, as stepping on one can destroy your cloak and/or shirt. Wear a ring of polymorph control or amulet of unchanging (unless you have a better amulet) stop yourself from polymorphing and breaking your armor. If you have neither, wear disposable junk armor below level 9. Automatic searching can also help you find and avoid polymorph traps, especially if you also have high luck.\nThe only body armors which are worth the downsides are gray dragon scale mail and silver dragon scale mail. Picking one over the other depends on which extrinsics you already have from other sources.\nIf you can almost but not quite hit consistently while wearing body armor, try augmenting your to-hit bonus with gauntlets of dexterity or a ring of increase accuracy. \nAs a rule of thumb, start thinking about wearing body armor when you have a luckstone, increased your luck to maximum, strength of at least 17, and the sum of your dexterity, experience level, and artifact weapon enchantment is at least 35-40. If you are weaponless, and achieved the grand master level, take 4 for weapon enchantment. Add 1 to the sum if your strength is 18/50 to 18/99, and 2 if it is 18/** or better.\nFor Monks wearing body armor, it is a good idea to get rid of the penalty by self-polymorphing before the most demanding tasks, like killing Master Kaen; see the relevant section on polymorph control for a list creatures who can wear all armor. Alternatively, you may simply remove your own body armor before the fight, provided your AC is good enough without it.\nMaxing out your healing and clerical spellcasting skills is probably not worth it if you can keep wearing your robe. Neutral Monks who cast lots of spells will likely want to wish for the Eye of the Aethiopica for energy regeneration.\nIn addition to rounding out your ascension kit, you might also want a silver object for fighting undead and demons in Gehennom. Weaponless Monks can remove their gloves and wear a silver ring for attacking shades, or wield a silver non-weapon such as the Bell of Opening.\nThe crowning gift of a spellbook of restore ability is often considered worthless, as its primary function will have long been superseded by the unicorn horn, and a blessed potion of restore ability can also serve the same purpose while additionally restoring lost levels. Both this and the Monk's obtainable intrinsics from gaining experience levels suggest that a Monk player should probably avoid being crowned, so as to preserve a shorter prayer timeout.\nA highly-enchanted double-damage weapon like one of the Brands, even at Unskilled, will do significantly more damage than martial arts at Grand Master level. See The Monk FAQ for an in-depth comparison of average damage. Monks not attempting the weaponless conduct may want to switch to using an artifact weapon once they get something powerful enough (and once they are high enough level to hit monsters even with the Unskilled to-hit penalty). Alternatively, using their existing weapon skills, a fully enchanted silver spear wielded with gauntlets of power can also be effective, especially in Gehennom against the numerous silver-hating foes there.\nObtaining weapons through sacrifice will unrestrict the relevant skills, which is especially important for Monks.\nShuriken are a good ranged option for late game Monks. If you want a large number of them, you will probably have to polypile for them. In 3.6.0, Monks have a +1 multishot bonus for throwing shuriken.\nAt this point you should be able to overcome the body armor penalty entirely with high stats and luck, or possibly through self-polymorph. You should be wearing body armor unless you have some good reason not to, or else are roleplaying.\nOnce you start wearing body armor, you should also get a shield, which doesn't have any further adverse effects on melee combat if you already have body armor, and doesn't affect your martial arts. However, note that shields can impede spellcasting. A shield of reflection in particular can free up your amulet slot for something more useful.\nIt is likely that extremely high level spells like finger of death will remain out of your reach, but don't underestimate the power of the middling spells. Magic missile in particular is probably your most powerful ranged attack.\nThe status line shows you to be one of the following ranks when you reach the specified experience level:\nBULLET::::- XL 1-2: Candidate\nBULLET::::- XL 3-5: Novice\nBULLET::::- XL 6-9: Initiate\nBULLET::::- XL 10-13: Student of Stones\nBULLET::::- XL 14-17: Student of Waters\nBULLET::::- XL 18-21: Student of Metals\nBULLET::::- XL 22-25: Student of Winds\nBULLET::::- XL 26-29: Student of Fire\nBULLET::::- XL 30: Master\nIn the Monk quest, the player fights Master Kaen for the Eyes of the Overworld.\nIn UnNetHack, monks get a bonus point of AC while confused as a reference to the idea of drunken boxing.\nIn SLASH'EM, Monks also have the largest number of techniques of any role. Most of these are martial arts-themed offensive moves that make the Monk a more balanced role.\nThey don't suffer to-hit penalty for wearing body armor (unless fighting bare-handed).\nTheir first sacrifice gift are the Gauntlets of Defense.\nIn dNetHack, Monks continue to gain intrinsics after level 17:\nBULLET::::- Level 19: acid resistance\nBULLET::::- Level 21: water walking\nBULLET::::- Level 23: sickness resistance\nBULLET::::- Level 25: disintegration resistance\nBULLET::::- Level 27: stoning resistance\nBULLET::::- Level 29: magic resistance\nBULLET::::- Level 30: drain resistance\nTheir crowning gift is the Grandmaster's Robe, which improves their unarmed attacks while worn.\n",
    "caveman": "Caveman\nThe caveman (cavewoman if female) is one of the player roles in NetHack. Cavemen can be either lawful or neutral, and can be humans, dwarves or gnomes.\nTheir special spell is dig and their default starting pet is a little dog called Slasher. Cavemen suffer no consequences from cannibalism. The guidebook has little to say about cavemen:\nCaveman may be seen as a weaker, less advantaged version of Valkyrie. Certainly, they are a more difficult role and are more likely to appeal to the player looking for a bit of a challenge. In the gallery of NetHack's warrior-type roles, they have very few comparative advantages; among them, however, is the lack of penalties for cannibalism and the fact that their quest artifact is considered one of the best in the game.\nEach caveman starts with the following:\nBULLET::::- a +1 club\nBULLET::::- a +2 sling\nBULLET::::- 10 to 22 flint stones\nBULLET::::- 18 to 33 rocks\nBULLET::::- a +0 leather armor\nCavemen gain intrinsics at these experience levels:\nBULLET::::- Level 7: speed\nBULLET::::- Level 15: warning\nCavemen start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Club\", \"Sling\" and \"Bare hands\".\nCavemen do not suffer any penalty for cannibalism.\nCavemen start with a ready source of ranged weapons in their sling and a set flintstones and rocks, but they are quite heavy and will make the player want to drop them very quickly. Like all ranged weapons, they're handy for wearing down powerful opponents or killing enemies with deadly passive attacks like floating eyes. Upon finding a replacement ranged weapon or two, you can freely drop all the starting rocks. The starting club should be just enough to tide the player over until they can find a better weapon.\nCavemen can reach expert in clubs, including the aklys; prior to 3.6.1, the aklys was simply an iron club that got a to-hit bonus when thrown. As of 3.6.1, it is a tetherable weapon that will return 99% of the time when thrown while it is wielded. Once you locate a non-cursed aklys or two, it can easily pull double duty as both a ranged and melee weapon. Spears, especially the dwarvish spear, are also a solid weapon choice, since Cavemen are the only class besides the Ranger that can reach Expert in spear; they can also stack and be used as projectiles, and the dwarvish spear has the best base damage after the silver spear.\nLeather armor should be dumped for anything better, hopefully a mithril-coat, as soon as possible. Your very poor starting AC can improve substantially if you use your pet to curse-test all the armor you find, and continually swap out worse pieces for better ones. Leather rots, so stay away from puddings while you are wearing your starting suit.

Another good option is a mace, which is superior to a club and allows you to train the mace skill in anticipation of your quest artifact, The Sceptre of Might.

    "cavewoman": "Caveman\nThe caveman (cavewoman if female) is one of the player roles in NetHack. Cavemen can be either lawful or neutral, and can be humans, dwarves or gnomes.\nTheir special spell is dig and their default starting pet is a little dog called Slasher. Cavemen suffer no consequences from cannibalism. The guidebook has little to say about cavemen:\nCaveman may be seen as a weaker, less advantaged version of Valkyrie. Certainly, they are a more difficult role and are more likely to appeal to the player looking for a bit of a challenge. In the gallery of NetHack's warrior-type roles, they have very few comparative advantages; among them, however, is the lack of penalties for cannibalism and the fact that their quest artifact is considered one of the best in the game.\nEach caveman starts with the following:\nBULLET::::- a +1 club\nBULLET::::- a +2 sling\nBULLET::::- 10 to 22 flint stones\nBULLET::::- 18 to 33 rocks\nBULLET::::- a +0 leather armor\nCavemen gain intrinsics at these experience levels:\nBULLET::::- Level 7: speed\nBULLET::::- Level 15: warning\nCavemen start with \"Basic\" skill in \"Club\", \"Sling\" and \"Bare hands\".\nCavemen do not suffer any penalty for cannibalism.\nCavemen start with a ready source of ranged weapons in their sling and a set flintstones and rocks, but they are quite heavy and will make the player want to drop them very quickly. Like all ranged weapons, they're handy for wearing down powerful opponents or killing enemies with deadly passive attacks like floating eyes. Upon finding a replacement ranged weapon or two, you can freely drop all the starting rocks. The starting club should be just enough to tide the player over until they can find a better weapon.\nCavemen can reach expert in clubs, including the aklys; prior to 3.6.1, the aklys was simply an iron club that got a to-hit bonus when thrown. As of 3.6.1, it is a tetherable weapon that will return 99% of the time when thrown while it is wielded. Once you locate a non-cursed aklys or two, it can easily pull double duty as both a ranged and melee weapon. Spears, especially the dwarvish spear, are also a solid weapon choice, since Cavemen are the only class besides the Ranger that can reach Expert in spear; they can also stack and be used as projectiles, and the dwarvish spear has the best base damage after the silver spear.\nLeather armor should be dumped for anything better, hopefully a mithril-coat, as soon as possible. Your very poor starting AC can improve substantially if you use your pet to curse-test all the armor you find, and continually swap out worse pieces for better ones. Leather rots, so stay away from puddings while you are wearing your starting suit. Due to Cavemen possessing the second-largest spellcasting penalty of all classes (topped only by the Barbarian), high AC should be the main priority.\nAfter gaining a few levels, non-human cavemen may want to head to the Gnomish Mines as soon as reasonably possible; they will not only have an easier time dealing with the inhabitants, but can more easily procure a better set of weapons and armor using their pet if they so choose.

    "water moccasin": "Water moccasin\nA water moccasin, , is a variety of snake, virtually identical to the normal snake but not generated at random. Like regular snakes, water moccasins will hide under items, are poisonous to eat, and have a 27% chance of imparting poison resistance, slightly higher than a snake (26%).\nThey are generated only in groups by quaffing from (or dipping an item into) a fountain; their presence in the absence of fountain quaffing is indicative of bones or a rogue shapeshifter.\nIndiviually, water moccasins are similar enough to snakes that they can be dispatched in a similar manner. However, on top of necessitating poison resistance as usual, their decent speed and appearance in swarms will require efficient crowd control tactics, which may be further complicated if previous uses of the fountain caused pools of water to form. This makes it a potent source of deaths for unsuspecting low-level characters; fortunately, players who do not use fountains will never have to deal with them, while those who wait until after the early game will likely be prepared.\nDue to their affiliation with fountain quaffing, they are the fourth most frequent cause of death on nethack.alt.org (next to soldier ants, jackals, and wands); it is common in the #nethack channel on Freenode to exclaim \"Go team fountain!\" on hearing of a water moccasin death.\nWater moccasins are a species of venomous snake well known in the southeastern United States.\n",
    "ghost": "Ghost\nA ghost, , is a type of monster in NetHack. In vanilla, both the ghost and the shade are the only members of the \"ghost\" monster class.\nGhosts are most likely to appear in bones levels, copies of levels where previous players died. Most causes of death will leave a player ghost behind; see the article on bones files for more information and exceptions. These ghosts are generated asleep on top of their original inventories, and has the same experience level as the late player; their pet(s) may be nearby, and are very likely to have turned feral. Any objects that were carried in the deceased player's main inventory have an 80% chance of becoming cursed, even if they were originally blessed. Other objects on the level and the contents of containers in the player's inventory maintain their BUC status.\nGhosts will also appear in graveyards, including the Valley of the Dead's three large graveyards and the graveyard in Orcus Town. A ghost is also generated on the Rogue level, in Asmodeus' Lair, and in Baalzebub's Lair. \nGhosts will occasionally spawn when you step into haunted temples. Quaffing a milky potion may cause a ghost to appear.\nGhosts of past players found in bones files are named after the dead adventurer they represent. The ghost generated on the Rogue level is named \"Michael Toy\", \"Kenneth Arnold\", or \"Glenn Wichman\".\nGhosts created on other special levels have a 1/7 chance of being given your character's name. Otherwise, they are given a random name from the following list:\nBULLET::::- Adri\nBULLET::::- Andries\nBULLET::::- Andreas\nBULLET::::- Bert\nBULLET::::- David\nBULLET::::- Dirk\nBULLET::::- Emile\nBULLET::::- Frans\nBULLET::::- Fred\nBULLET::::- Greg\nBULLET::::- Hether\nBULLET::::- Jay\nBULLET::::- John\nBULLET::::- Jon\nBULLET::::- Karnov\nBULLET::::- Kay\nBULLET::::- Kenny\nBULLET::::- Kevin\nBULLET::::- Maud\nBULLET::::- Michiel\nBULLET::::- Mike\nBULLET::::- Peter\nBULLET::::- Robert\nBULLET::::- Ron\nBULLET::::- Tom\nBULLET::::- Wilmar\nBULLET::::- Nick Danger\nBULLET::::- Phoenix\nBULLET::::- Jiro\nBULLET::::- Mizue\nBULLET::::- Stephan\nBULLET::::- Lance Braccus\nBULLET::::- Shadowhawk\nGhosts are \"very\" slow and do very little damage, and in most scenarios involving a bones pile they can usually be led away with little trouble. However, they possess a very low AC, and will likely evade most attacks if met at a low experience level. If you are unable to dispatch them via regular attack, kicking them may work instead. Even though the ghost may not be too difficult to dispatch, be wary that you do not forget about their original killer - you may very well become a ghost yourself if you are careless and the monster is still present.\nBy default, ghosts and shades are represented by a blank space, making them difficult to see and almost impossible to locate by telepathy. Some players use the SYMBOLS option to give ghosts and shades a different appearance, such as or . This makes them easier to see and allows you to shortly identify bones levels via telepathy.\nWhen a player leaves a bones file, they leave a corpse and a ghost under regular circumstances; if you use undead turning on the corpse, the ghost inhabits the player's corpse on the item pile, removing the ghost. If successful, the message \"Name's ghost is suddenly drawn into its former body!\" is displayed.\nThe ghost must be on or adjacent to the square the corpse is on, and must be awake to be turned. The corpse can be of a polymorphed form if the target died while in another form, e.g. from wearing an amulet of unchanging. If the ghost is tame, then the resulting monster is tame, and is otherwise generated peaceful or hostile as normal based on your alignment and race. The monster will also be confused upon resurrection.\nIn xNetHack, the ghost's base level is reduced to 4, their speed is increased to 5, their AC is increased to 5, and their magic resistance is increased to 80.\nSimilar to shades, ghosts can only be hit by magic, blessed weapons, artifact weapons, or objects made of silver or bone. Unlike shades, ghosts do not take silver damage.\nInstead of their 1-damage touch attack, hostile ghosts turn invisible every so often and try to frighten the player by reappearing next to them. When this happens, the player is paralyzed for three turns. This is not prevented by free action, but it will not work if the player is able to sense the invisible ghost. of ghosts will generate invisible.\nBULLET::::- Shade\n",

    "long worm tail": "Long worm\nA long worm, , is a monster that occupies several squares. Only its head can attack, but if it is hit in the middle (even with bare hands), it may divide into two. Attacking the tip of its tail cannot cause it to split, making it a good way to kill long worms. Unlike purple worms, long worms cannot engulf their enemies.\nWhen killed, long worms leave behind a worm tooth along with their corpse. The tooth can be enchanted to create a crysknife.\nPet long worms and their baby forms cannot be displaced, which is annoying if you want to improve it with a polytrap. The DevTeam intended the whole length of a long worm to be dangerous, but currently software limitations prevent this.\nLong worms that spawn during level creation are usually generated asleep, unless you are carrying the Amulet of Yendor.\nA long worm technically respects Elbereth and other means of scaring. However, if a worm is frightened but is currently stuck, it will proceed to attack you with its head and all of its tail segments next to you. This is the only way to see this in action, presumably due to a bug.\nThe long worm is one of the oldest monsters in NetHack history, having been around since Jay Fenlason's Hack. It is unknown if its behavior was different than it is in modern NetHack.\nPrior to 3.6.0, splitting a long worm was dangerous, as it could cause the game to crash under certain circumstances (see bug C343-324). This bug was marked \"fixed\" after NetHack 3.4.3.\nThe long worm represents the , or rather a small and thus a very young sandworm, from 's \"\" series of novels. This is suggested by the fact that long worms are excessively large (for NetHack), by the encyclopedia entry, and by the fact they drop a worm tooth, which may be made into a crysknife, as in the novels.

    "wraith": "Wraith\nThe wraith, , is a type of monster that appears in Nethack and its many variants. They are often found in graveyards, and are known for the fact that eating a fresh wraith corpse causes the player character to gain an experience level. However, wraiths may also drain levels from them.\nIn addition to normal generation and graveyards, if a player is slain by a member of the wraith monster class, which also includes barrow wights or Nazguls, that player rises from the grave as a wraith rather than a traditional ghost..\nThe level gained from eating a wraith's corpse makes them a popular choice for reverse genocide, and the corpses provide zero nutrition, reducing the risk of overeating. However, an oversatiated character can still choke on them. There is a chance the corpse will \"rot away completely\" and provide no experience - dipping it in holy water has no effect on this probability. It isn't possible to tin wraith corpses, but they can be kept fresh in an ice box.\nThose discovering the bones of a player killed by a will have to contend with the tougher spirit of the former player, as wraiths can use wands and read scrolls; on top of the former inventory, the wraith can still drain levels as well.\nLike all undead, wraiths killed on a level with a graveyard (or the Castle, which counts as a graveyard level for this purpose) are much less likely to leave a corpse, with 1/9 of the normal 50% chance if killed by the player, or 1/3 of the normal chance if killed by anything else. To get around this, a player may lure the wraith up or down a stairway before dispatching it, or branch-/level teleport while the wraith is adjacent. Alternatively, graveyard wraiths can be saved for a pet purple worm; their engulfing attack is not subject to corpse-leaving odds. Polymorphed players do not gain levels from swallowing live wraiths, though.\nEither magic cancellation level 3 or drain resistance is highly recommended for a player transporting wraiths. Magic cancellation will not completely prevent level drain, but decreases the odds of being drained of a second level before one can gain a single experience point (e.g. by killing the wraith) and regain the previously drained one.\nIn SLASH'EM, wraiths need a +1 weapon to hit. They also frequently wear robes.\nSLASH'EM's wraith corpses have different effects if eaten:\n! Possibility !! Effect !! Message\nNethack's incarnation of wraiths originate from Dungeons and Dragons.

    "dwarf": "Dwarf\nA dwarf is a type of monster in \"NetHack\", and is also a playable race. It also characterizes several dwarf-related monsters.\nAccording to the guide book:\nDwarves are always lawful. They can be Archeologists, Cavemen, or Valkyries. \nDwarves have intrinsic infravision. From an attribute perspective, dwarves have good physical attributes (the highest dexterity and constitution), but those are offset by the lowest mental attributes. The following table outlines their maximum (unaided) attribute levels.\n! Strength \n! Dexterity\n! Constitution\n! Intelligence\n! Wisdom\n! Charisma\nWhen playing as a dwarf, you will see yourself as (unless you have showrace on), but you are considered to be \"both\" and . For this reason, using blessed genocide to eliminate mind flayers (entering codice_1 at the prompt) is a Bad Idea, as it will result in an instadeath. Therefore, dwarves must use two uncursed genocides to eliminate both mind flayers and master mind flayers, while other characters can eliminate them both with a single blessed genocide.\nCuriously, there is no dwarf role that seems especially \"dwarvish\"\u2014Cavemen are primitive, Archeologists are combat-averse scientists, and Valkyries are Norse psychopomps. The typical fantasy vision of the dwarf warrior, craftsman, or miner is therefore not really available to the player of \"NetHack\".\nThe monster flag M2_DWARF determines if a monster is considered to be a sort of dwarf or otherwise of dwarvish origin. The following monsters have this flag:\nThe following objects are defined as dwarven objects. Strangely, the code doesn't actually use this definition anywhere.\nWeapons:\nBULLET::::- Dwarvish mattock (broad pick)\nBULLET::::- Dwarvish short sword (broad short sword)\nBULLET::::- Dwarvish spear (stout spear)\nArmor:\nBULLET::::- Dwarvish iron helm (hard hat)\nBULLET::::- Dwarvish mithril-coat\nBULLET::::- Dwarvish cloak (hooded cloak)\nBULLET::::- Dwarvish roundshield (large round shield)\nNo dwarvish artifacts currently exist in the game.\nDwarvish items are said to be exceptional metalworks, and their stats generally show this: they are superior to orcish and non-racial counterparts, and are largely better (if heavier) than elven counterparts.\nDwarves in dNetHack can additionally take on the Noble or Knight role. Dwarves in one of these roles get special quests, the Dwarf Noble and Dwarf Knight quest. Dwarves begin the game knowing all four stave-wards.\n",
    "leprechaun": "Leprechaun\nA leprechaun, , is a monster that can steal gold from players. It is the only vanilla member of the leprechaun monster class.\nLeprechauns have teleportitis, and will approach and try to attack you when you have gold in your open inventory, otherwise running away from you. When you attack a leprechaun which is not frozen, asleep, confused, or blind, it has a chance of moving one square away instead of being hit. When this happens, you will move instead of attacking, with a message being printed when this occurs as of NetHack 3.6.0.\nEating a leprechaun's corpse has a 50% chance of conveying teleportitis, and you will also gain teleportitis while polymorphed into a leprechaun.\nLeprechauns are normally generated sleeping and with \"LD\"d\"30\" pieces of gold. Leprechaun halls can be found in the dungeon and are filled with sleeping leprechauns, each on top of some gold, in a similar manner to a treasure zoo.\nLeprechauns are annoyances that are best dealt with via ranged weapons or spells. For most players, the leprechaun poses no real threat\u2014however, its predilection toward escape rather than fighting can make it time-consuming to kill. Occasionally, they may stop to attack you if you keep next to them; they will have no choice but to stop and fight if you prevent them from moving anywhere else.\nIf you are a Knight, awaken leprechauns before attacking them to avoid alignment penalties; other roles will want to get as close as possible so they have a chance to cut off the leprechaun's escape path. If possible, close or obstruct doors in a room to limit their movement, and make use of your pet to pick them off; leprechauns cannot open doors, and pets will not have to deal with wild misses as players do.\nYou can prevent them from teleporting as often by stashing your gold in a container or leaving it on a distant floor space; alternately, you can throw your gold at them, then run the fleeing leprechaun into a corner. You may have trouble if a leprechaun is generated with or comes across an escape wand, such as a wand of \u2014or worse, a wand of digging\u2014because in most cases you will have to force them to exhaust all their charges.\nAmusingly, using a ring of conflict in a leprechaun hall will cause them to steal from each other\u2014but it will soon prove annoying, as this scatters them across the level.\nLeprechauns can be exploited for credit cloning. Drop all but one of your gold coins in a shop, lure a leprechaun inside, let it pick up the pile of gold, then let it steal you or just teleport out. Once you find it and kill it to get your gold back, you'll still have your credit; since you can only do this once per leprechaun, you should do it with as much gold as possible. Using leprechauns this way is difficult since, unlike pets, they won't follow you, but it does mean you can credit clone even without a pet or, as of 3.6.0, without a sack.\nPolymorphing into a leprechaun lets you steal gold from monsters, but generally, this is rather pointless; shopkeepers support credit cloning, priests have little gold and are too powerful when you still need protection, and other monsters can simply be killed.\nIn xNetHack, leprechauns are moved into the monster class and are represented by . (The glyph is now occupied by the lizards.) Like other minor demons, leprechauns are subject to bonus damage from iron and silver weapons. Leprechauns are also capable of stealing gold items as well as gold pieces.\nIn variants featuring an object materials system, it is very common to give leprechauns the ability to steal gold items.\nBULLET::::- Borrow is a SLASH'EM\u00a0technique to steal gold from monsters.\n",
    "beholder": "Beholder\nBeholder may refer to:\nBULLET::::- the Beholder monster in SLASH'EM and dNethack\nBULLET::::- a deferred monster in vanilla NetHack\n",
    "vorpal jabberwock": "Vorpal jabberwock\nThe vorpal jabberwock is an unused monster in vanilla NetHack which has been implemented in SLASH'EM, GruntHack, UnNetHack, SpliceHack, and EvilHack.\nIn every incarnation, the vorpal jabberwock is a more powerful version of the regular jabberwock, appearing as . Like the regular jabberwock, it is especially vulnerable to being beheaded by Vorpal Blade (and other methods of decapitation, depending on the variant).\nThe vorpal jabberwock possesses multiple beheading attacks, each with a 5% chance of instantly beheading you on every successful hit (100% chance if you are polymorphed into a jabberwock or vorpal jabberwock yourself; 0% if you are currently headless or amorphous). Additionally, jabberwocks can grow up into vorpal jabberwocks.\nIn UnNetHack, the vorpal jabberwock behaves very similarly to GruntHack's version, except that the chance of beheading is only 2.5% per hit, and canceling the vorpal jabberwock prevents it from beheading anything.\nIn EvilHack, the vorpal jabberwock behaves very similarly to GruntHack's version. Additionally, it is one of the alternate forms the Wizard of Yendor may take on, and monsters may use a wish for a figurine of a vorpal jabberwock.\nThe SLASH'EM version of the vorpal jabberwock possesses no beheading attack, will not grow up from a regular jabberwock, does not generate in Gehennom, and is not especially vulnerable to being decapitated by Vorpal Blade.\nSpliceHack's vorpal jabberwock acts mostly like SLASH'EM's version, except that Vorpal Blade will still always decapitate it.\n",
    "vampire mage": "Vampire mage\nVampire mage may refer to:\nBULLET::::- the deferred feature in vanilla NetHack\nBULLET::::- the vampire mage monster in SLASH'EM\n",
    "earendil": "Earendil\nEarendil was the quest leader for male elves prior to 3.3.0, and the Drow quest nemesis in versions of SLASH'EM before race and role were separated. It should be noted that in SLASH'EM, his MR is changed to 50, and his alignment is changed to 20. The reason for the alignment change is likely because in SLASH'EM, Elves are lawful by default.\nElwing was the quest leader for female elves prior to 3.3.0. Other than her name and gender, she has the same stats as Earendil.\n",
    "goblin king": "Goblin King\nThe Goblin King was the Elf quest nemesis prior to 3.3.0.\n",
    "high-elf": "High-elf\nThe High-elf is a defunct feature in NetHack that can still be found in the source code. High-elves were the quest guardians for the Elf quest, back when the elf was considered a role.\nHigh-elves will not be randomly generated, but they remain a part of the source code.\nHigh-elves are also present in the source code of SLASH'EM. There they are grouped with other elves rather than the quest guardians, but they have a frequency of 0 and so are never randomly generated. It is possible to polymorph into one, however.\nHigh-elves in SLASH'EM have a base level of 7 and an alignment of 9, making them lawful, unlike their vanilla counterparts.\n",
    "owlbear": "Owlbear\nThe owlbear is one of the more dangerous low level monsters you'll face in NetHack, although usually not as lethal as those that appear in groups (like soldier ants).\nOwlbears have a grabbing attack in which the owlbear bearhugs you, holding you in place and crushing you. \nThey were introduced way back in Hack 1.0.\nYou can safely kill an owlbear from afar with ranged weapons, spells, or wands. If you are caught in the grabbing attack, you can teleport away. Using sleep or paralysis, such as from a wand of sleep or thrown potion, on the owlbear has a chance of releasing you, but not always (and if not, it also might wake the owlbear when you try to move away).\nEngraving Elbereth can also cause the Owlbear to flee and release you.\nThe owlbear is probably inspired by the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" monster of the same name.\nAs the name suggests, they are a cross between a giant owl and a bear; they stand upright on two legs and have fur, feathers, and a beak.\n",
    "homunculus": "Homunculus\nThe homunculus, , is a minor demon in \"NetHack\". Its bite can put unwary adventurers to sleep. Its corpse is poisonous and has a small chance of conveying poison or sleep resistance.\nHomunculi will normally be peaceful if you are appropriately chaotic.\nWhile the bite attack is not as dangerous as the floating eye's gaze, the fact that it can leave you temporarily helpless represents a hazard. Since homunculi can potentially put you to sleep, it is best to take them out with ranged attacks or avoid them altogether. Sleep resistance will nullify their sleeping bite and make it much safer to fight them hand-to-hand, as they can only do 3 damage at most.\nThe homunculus appears in alchemical writings of the sixteenth century as an artificial creation in the shape of a miniature, fully formed human. These are not to be confused with the modern , which is a distorted scale model of the human body representing its relative brain space.\n",
    "yellow light": "Yellow light\nA yellow light attacks the hero by exploding when adjacent (destroying itself in the process), causing blindness but no other damage. The blindness will last for 10d20 turns.\nAs yellow lights can't see invisible, if you are invisible or displaced they may explode at an empty square with no blinding effect.\nThe explosion of a yellow light will wake nearby sleeping monsters.\nIt is possible to generate yellow lights by reading a scroll of light while confused. This has a 20% chance of happening.\nThe best course of action is to put on a blindfold or towel and wait for it to explode, or to have a blindness cure ready. If it is invisible and you do not see invisible, there is a chance based on your level that it will not affect you. This will generate the message \"Something explodes, but you get the feeling it wasn't too bright\".\n",
    "gas spore": "Gas spore\nA gas spore, , is a monster that appears early in NetHack. It is the weakest of the spheres, cannot attack on its own, and is rather slow; however, they act as \"living mines\", exploding in a small radius when its HP is depleted.\nIt is perfectly fine to simply avoid attacking gas spores altogether, as they are incapable of attacking you. However, other monsters may accidentally cause a gas spore explosion with ranged attacks or an attack prompted by conflict; pets in particular will begin attacking gas spores once they are high enough level, which may endanger you if you are not similar.\nThe best strategy when faced with a gas spore that you can reasonably fight (or else cannot avoid) is to step back and use whatever ranged attacks you have at your disposal - offensive spells, arrows, darts, or even throwing rocks and junk weapons. If you have no other options, no peaceful or tame monsters are nearby, and/or you have more than 24 HP along with a good AC, you can take a chance and dispatch the spore with melee attacks.\nEarly-game Healers can use gas spores to train their skills, such as the knife skill (with the starting scalpel) or the more common dagger. They can use a stethoscope to monitor the gas spore's HP and allow it to heal back up before attacking again; while any class can do this, Healers are the only one guaranteed to start with the stethoscope. \nThe gas spore's explosion does anywhere from 4 to 24 points of damage, making it a potential game-ending danger for early characters. The gas spore explodes when its HP is reduced to 0; if its death is from deadly poisoning, a death ray, or another effect that does not cause hit point loss, it will not explode.\nYou are responsible for any damage done by a gas spore explosion that you cause. This has a number of repercussions depending on the monster that has been damaged:\nBULLET::::- Pets killed by the gas spore explosion are treated as if you had killed them directly, i.e. -15 alignment and -1 luck.\nBULLET::::- Peaceful monsters become angry at you. Shopkeepers, aligned priests, watchmen and other \"always peaceful\" monsters in that vein will cause you plenty of grief.\nBULLET::::- However, other hostile monsters can be killed by the explosion; as you gain experience for each kill, this can possibly allow you to rise a quick level or two if the opportunity arises.\nKeep in mind that gas spore explosions create a loud noise which will wake sleeping monsters; directing gas spores into leprechaun halls or barracks is a fun, if somewhat risky maneuver.\n",
    "manes": "Manes\nThe manes, , is a minor demon that appears in \"NetHack\". Manes can grow up to become lemures.\nManes are frequently generated in large groups.\nManes are very weak and slow, although their three attacks are more than their ostensibly more difficult relative, the lemure. Individually, they are usually very easy to defeat for all but the weakest of characters; however, swarms of them can overwhelm weaker characters since their three attacks can hit for up to 10 HP total per manes.\nThese will likely be the first set of monsters where getting into a corridor or door is employed as a tactic; this prevents more than one of them from approaching at a time, making dispatching them much easier.\nIn Roman mythology, (MAH-nays) are the spirits of the dead. The word \"manes\" is Latin, and has a singular form, \"manis\", but the singular is not used for the meaning specific to these spirits; in English the word has no singular, and so NetHack just uses \"manes\" for the singular as well. Compare \"lemure\".\nIn SLASH'EM, manes are considerably stronger, but still very slow, making them a surprise threat to an early character. Hit and run can be a valuable tactic for the first few levels.\n",

The high chance comes from the fact that the base level of the elf monster is considerably higher than other base race monsters.\nZapping an aligned priest corpse with turn undead will instead produce a human zombie.\nPlayer first encounter Ettin zombies, well before encountering normal Ettins.\nGiant zombies leave rotten giant corpses. These may be tinned and then eaten for the strength gain.\nThe variant dNetHack adds two new types of zombie: the Drow zombie and half-dragon zombie.\nAlso, dNethack zombies can now rise from the dead similar to GruntHack zombies. However, they lack the sickness inducing bite. All non-undead will attack zombies on sight. Any monster killed by a zombie will eventually revive as one if a corpse is left, however the player will not (as of yet).\nIn dNetHack, the class also includes the skeletal pirate, gnoll ghoul, and dread seraph.\nEven in death, the half-dragon zombie retains the half-dragon breath attack it had in life.\nThe zombie is a mindless animated corpse. It originates from Haitian folklore. The etymology comes from African or Caribbean creole of related concepts.\nThe folklore of the Ghoul is a bit unclear, but it is not considered a Zombie.\n",

    "black pudding": "Black pudding\nThe black pudding, , is an amoeboid monster that appear in \"NetHack\". Its most noteworthy characteristic, shared with the brown pudding, is its ability to divide when hit by an iron item; this leaves two puddings, each with half the health of the original. Unlike the brown pudding, the black pudding also has a passive corrosion attack that degrades the iron weapon, as well as a damaging and corrosive bite.\nThe black pudding is considered a fleshy monster, and is not vegetarian. This is a pun on \u2014note also the sausage-like tile used in the default graphical tileset.\nKicking a sink has a chance of generating a black pudding; only one can be produced per sink.\nAs black puddings can be encountered early in the game and their low speed makes their powerful bite easily avoidable, providing a tempting source of experience for early characters, especially those with a means of ranged attack. However, in addition to taking damage and possibly injuring your leg, this can also summon a foocubus of opposite sex to the adventurer, which may result in death, especially if the seduction results in a level drain while still at level 1. Characters that already have levels should thus weigh the risks accordingly.\nCharacters fighting black puddings in general should ensure that their armor and weapons are not damaged. Rustproof any iron armor and weapons you plan to use for the long-term, and consider using a cloak or robe to cover your body armor. You can also step away and remove the armor in question if this would not impact your AC too much, or else wear a substitute junk item (e.g. a non-cursed +0 orcish helm) if possible. As for weapons, you can also use disposable projectiles such as rocks or darts, or non-iron weapons such as elven daggers or a silver saber.\nWhen a pudding splits, the current HP are divided equally between the two new puddings, so each split produces weaker ones until the pudding dies from hitpoint loss; if things threaten to get out of hand, kill the newer puddings first before they have time to regenerate. This was once a core component of pudding farming; as of NetHack 3.6.0, black puddings leave globs instead of corpses when they are killed. Globs cannot be sacrificed, revived or tinned, making pudding farming a far less useful tactic.\nIf you have a pudding pet and a polymorph trap, you can split it, yielding more pets to polymorph. As the name is also cloned, you might want to rename them. When doing this, take care to use a Puddingbane, lest you kill your pet(s) and suffer the penalty; see Abuse for the ramifications of attacking and splitting your pet. \nIn earlier versions, killing black puddings left normal corpses (which could be eaten to provide useful intrinsics or sacrificed for a variety of gains) and death drops, leading to the infamous practice of pudding farming. However, Nethack 3.6.0 eliminated the ability of puddings to drop corpses, making this practice ineffective and pointless.\nIn NetHack 3.6.0, globs could not give resistances when eaten; this was fixed in 3.6.1.\nIn SLASH'EM and Slash'EM Extended, black puddings never leave death drops, but they still drop normal corpses which can provide poison resistance (22%), cold resistance (22%) and shock resistance (22%). Pudding farming is still viable for sacrifice fodder and the aforementioned intrinsics.\nBlobs, puddings, and oozes share the same entry; see the amoeboid article.\nBULLET::::- Brown pudding\n",
    "brown pudding": "Brown pudding\nThe brown pudding, , is an amoeboid monster in \"NetHack\".\nLike its more powerful cousin, the black pudding, it will divide when hit by an iron weapon. Eating brown puddings is vegetarian, but not vegan.\nThe brown pudding's attacks do no damage, and its AC is rather high; its only danger lies in rotting your or your pet's armor. This can be easily avoided by any combination of wearing metal armor, covering your body armor with a throwaway cloak, or simply removing any organic armor. Pets without armor, such as domestic animals like dog, can freely dispose of a brown pudding.\nIf you have a pudding pet, you can hit it with iron items to cause the pet to split, yielding more pets for polymorphing; see abuse for the ramifications of attacking and splitting your pet. As the name is cloned, you might want to rename one. Alternately, consider splitting them first, then using a scroll of taming or a spell of charm monster if either is available. For pet splitting, a Puddingbane is recommended to avoid incurring alignment and luck penalties.\nBeginning in NetHack 3.6.0, brown puddings leave globs instead of corpses when they are killed. Globs cannot be sacrificed, revived or tinned, making pudding farming a less useful tactic than in previous versions of NetHack.

    "baby purple worm": "Purple worm\nThe purple worm is a monster in NetHack. It is a popular pet due to its engulfing attack, which can kill any monster that is large or smaller in one hit (\"Burrrrp!\").\nPurple worms will eat shriekers on sight; the reason given for this is that purple worms enjoy eating shriekers. \nWhen polymorphed into a purple worm, you sense shriekers on the level.\n1/13 of the monsters a shrieker summons with its shriek are purple worms; this can rarely cause a purple worm to appear very early in the dungeon.\nPurple worms tend to be dangerous if you are unprepared. This is because the purple worm can engulf you, and as soon that happens it will start to digest you (\"The purple worm digests you!\"). If you are not able to kill the purple worm fast, it will kill you. To ensure survival after being engulfed, immediately zap a wand of digging. The purple worm will have its health points dropped to 1, so one hit will get rid of it. See also engulfing. If you are wielding a cockatrice or chickatrice corpse, stoning the purple worm while inside will give the message: \"You jump through an opening in the new statue of a purple worm.\"\nWearing a ring of slow digestion will prevent a purple worm from killing you via engulfing, causing it to spit you out near-immediately.\nRanged attacks are of course also an option.\nBe careful when leaving pets around purple worms, as they will run up to the worm and promptly be engulfed. Pets that are engulfed die instantly. This is a good way to lose a very powerful pet.

    "purple worm": "Purple worm\nThe purple worm is a monster in NetHack. It is a popular pet due to its engulfing attack, which can kill any monster that is large or smaller in one hit (\"Burrrrp!\").\nPurple worms will eat shriekers on sight; the reason given for this is that purple worms enjoy eating shriekers. \nWhen polymorphed into a purple worm, you sense shriekers on the level.\n1/13 of the monsters a shrieker summons with its shriek are purple worms; this can rarely cause a purple worm to appear very early in the dungeon.\nPurple worms tend to be dangerous if you are unprepared. This is because the purple worm can engulf you, and as soon that happens it will start to digest you (\"The purple worm digests you!\"). If you are not able to kill the purple worm fast, it will kill you. To ensure survival after being engulfed, immediately zap a wand of digging. The purple worm will have its health points dropped to 1, so one hit will get rid of it. See also engulfing. If you are wielding a cockatrice or chickatrice corpse, stoning the purple worm while inside will give the message: \"You jump through an opening in the new statue of a purple worm.\"\nWearing a ring of slow digestion will prevent a purple worm from killing you via engulfing, causing it to spit you out near-immediately.\nRanged attacks are of course also an option.\nBe careful when leaving pets around purple worms, as they will run up to the worm and promptly be engulfed. Pets that are engulfed die instantly. This is a good way to lose a very powerful pet.

    "mail daemon": "Mail daemon\nThe mail daemon is ostensibly a monster in NetHack, but has extremely peculiar properties and appears rarely. Its primary function, as its name suggests, is to deliver mail to the player.\nWhen an item of mail needs to be delivered the daemon is placed on a square just out of sight of the player, rushes over to the location of the player (pushing anything in its path temporarily out of its way, exclaiming \"Gangway!\", \"Pardon me!\", \"Excuse me!\", etc.), hands the scroll to the player (\"Hello, player! I have some mail for you.\"), rushes back to its starting square, and disappears. If it can't maneuver next to the player for some reason, it will \"throw\" the scroll to the player with an exclamation of \"Catch!\" This all takes place within the space of one turn.\nOn nethack.alt.org, a user may observe other users' games. It is then possible to communicate to the player by sending mail. The player cannot send mail back to the spectator, but the # command can be used to type arbitrary messages visible to the observing user. The player does not need to attempt to execute the command, as the observer will see the message as it is typed in.\nIt is possible to create a mail daemon by means of wishing for a statue of it which can then be re-animated by casting stone to flesh. This is largely useless, as the resulting mail daemon will disappear in one turn (\"I'm late!\") unless you attack it, in which case it will disappear if you step away from it. Killing a mail daemon will automatically (and silently) genocide mail daemons, preventing future mail delivery and violating Genocideless conduct.\nMail daemons will not appear if MAIL is undefined when compiling the game, or if the mail option is set to codice_1.\nOn Unix-like operating systems, a is a program that runs in the background, performing various tasks such as managing log files, performing timed maintenance tasks or answering incoming network connection requests. The program responsible for receiving mail and dispatching it to the correct location is commonly referred to as the mail daemon.\nIn NetHack 3.4.3, a mail daemon could be created when creating random demons on a special level. This was bug C343-415. These mail daemons would immediately disappear as soon as the player moved.\nIn UnNetHack, in addition to delivering mail, the mail daemon can also deliver one hint scroll per game (assuming that this option is enabled). This \"helpful hint\" behavior has earned the mail daemon the nickname \"Unclippy - the helpful hint daemon\" (as a pejorative reference to the infamous Microsoft Word \"helper\", Clippy).\nBULLET::::- Spam \u2014 A short story by Virgo Vardja, set in the NetHack universe\nBULLET::::- Mail daemons in the Extinctionist Spoiler\n",
    "vampire": "Vampire\nVampires are a class of monster represented by the overall symbol , all of whom possess a characteristic life-draining bite. They will always be generated hostile, possess flight and magical breathing, and are vulnerable to silver weapons. The vampire, , is also the weakest monster of the class.\nThe members of the vampire class are:\nBULLET::::- vampire\n#chatting with vampires can give humorous messages. Standing on any altar scares vampires as if you were standing on Elbereth or a scroll of scare monster.\nAs of NetHack 3.6.0, vampires and vampire lords are capable of self-polymorph into vampire bats or fog clouds, and vampire lords may additionally transform into wolves. Vampires may polymorph into fog clouds at will to flow underneath doors that are locked or otherwise inaccessible to their other forms, and will usually shapeshift into their bat or wolf forms when out of the player's sight. Killing/destroying these alternate forms will cause the monster to resurrect in its vampire form.\nWhile not as strong, vampire pets will grow up quickly into vampire lords, and thus similar strategies apply; this includes the need to wear a ring of protection from shape changers in order to keep your pet in vampire form. The other forms are generally much weaker fighters and unable to wield weapons or wear armor; if killed in these forms, the vampire will resurrect into its normal form.\nPlayers polymorphed into any polymorph into vampire bats when the player polymorphs without polymorph control.\nIn SLASH'EM and UnNetHack, players polymorphed into a vampire can fly and do not need to breathe, but they cannot eat solid food and have to rely on fresh blood from corpses as their only food source; they may also get nutrition from combat using their \"bite\" attack in combat. If they wait too long, the blood will \"coagulate\", becoming useless as a nutrition source. While blood consumed in this manner provides a very small nutritional value, the drained corpses are still eligible for sacrifice, reducing the need to weigh staying full against sacrificing. The usual penalties apply for draining other humans, as well as dogs and cats.\nVampires are a starting race in SLASH'EM. In addition, there are three new types of Vampires:\nBULLET::::- Vampire mages\nBULLET::::- Fire vampires\nBULLET::::- Star vampires\nVampire mages can notably cast the summon nasties spell, while fire and star vampires are not undead, but extraterestials of Lovecraftian origin. Fire vampires are extremely fast and can cast unreflectable fire balls, while star vampires have six attacks per turn.\nUndead vampires (not star vampires and fire vampires) are often generated with opera cloaks, and can provide a valuable method of farming said cloaks, especially if it turns out to be a cloak of magic resistance; the tradeoff is making the vampires in question harder to dispatch, particularly vampire mages. Some spells that don't destroy potential loot, such as acid stream, are good substitutes for the usual magic missile assault in such scenarios.\nVampires are a starting race in UnNetHack. Enemy vampires are also often generated with opera cloaks, as in SLASH'EM.\nIn dNetHack, pet vampires will drain corpses for nutrition the same way a player vampire does, with similar conditions (i.e. less than 3 turns of age, has blood).\n",
    "vampire lord": "Vampire lord\nThe vampire lord, , is a more difficult vampire. Like its weaker brethren, it possesses the abilities of flight and magical breathing as well as the characteristic life-draining bite attack.\nBeginning in NetHack 3.6.0, vampires and vampire lords are capable of shapeshifting; vampire lords may become vampire bats, fog clouds, and wolves. These forms will resurrect as the vampire lord if they are killed/destroyed. The fog cloud form is notable for being able to pass under locked doors.\nVampire lords make excellent pets if you wear a ring of protection from shape changers. Without the ring, pet vampires will shapeshift. They are weak fighters in bat/wolf/cloud form, and if they are wearing armor, it will be destroyed when they become wolves. But if you do wear a ring (or play a version in which they do not shapeshift), vampire lords can wear all armor in addition to their base AC of 0, which makes them very hard to hit and allows you to give them some resistances. They also do not eat (except when shapeshifted), fly, and regenerate rapidly, and their drain life attack weakens the monster they and you are fighting. \nPet vampires will grow up into vampire lords, and are easier to tame because of their lower magic resistance. \n",
    "vlad the impaler": "Vlad the Impaler\nVlad the Impaler, , is a unique vampire that appears in \"NetHack\". He holds the Candelabrum of Invocation, and resides at the top of his tower in Gehennom.\nLike his weaker brethren he possesses the abilities of flight and magical breathing. He is also covetous, which means he will warp to the upstairs - or, in his tower, the ladder down - to heal.\nVlad the Impaler is always generated with a two-handed sword, a battle-axe, a bow and 3-14 arrows, or, with a 21% chance, nothing.\nVlad is the second fastest monster in the game, faster than a player with speed boots. His speed allows him to warp to you, hit you, bite you, and sometimes warp away again in a single turn before you get a chance to retaliate. Unlike other covetous monsters, if you are standing on the ladder yourself, he will warp away a few steps when hurt instead of staying next to the ladder. If you take the bait and follow, he may then escape down. This, combined with his high 130 HP, makes fighting him quite frustrating, especially for low-damage characters.\nHe hits hard, and often gets multiple hits for each of yours. Above all, he deals double damage during the midnight hour (0:00-0:59 server time) due to being undead, and he has all the powers of his subordinate vampires including drain life attacks. He is also immune to sleep, death rays, slowness, and polymorph. The quickest way to deal with him is to use a footrice corpse or a potion of paralysis. If neither of the two is available, you need decent AC and a well enchanted silver weapon to take him down quickly. Failing that, you can let him escape the tower into the main area of Gehennom, and stand on an upstair to fight him.\nBe careful not to confuse Vlad: if he levelports by a confused scroll of teleportation, you get to look for him in his Tower, all of Gehennom above it, and the entire Dungeons of Doom, which is very annoying. This also makes Magicbane an impractical choice.\nPrior to 3.6.1, Vlad used to be significantly slower, weaker and wouldn't teleport away. He was widely regarded as being quite a feeble enemy to be a mandatory fight at the stage of the game when he is faced; he was not significantly stronger than the vampire lords which appear as normal enemies.\nJokes abounded of fighting him with food rations, magic markers, thoroughly rusty thoroughly corroded tin openers (which could still rust back then) or orcish daggers, not moving every second turn while fighting him, or a variety of other absurd scenarios which would normally result in YASDs, and still easily defeating Vlad. The items used for such exploits had become known as Vladsbanes (or Vladbanes or Vladsmashers, in a mockery of the Banes) and on the occasions when such an item is used it is often so #named in tribute (see link below). The danger of confused levelport by Vlad even gave you a legitimate reason to use a Vladbane-type weapon instead of Magicbane.\nA variety of patches had been written before 3.6.1 to address this issue by altering Vlad in some way. One of the better known ones was the aptly-named Vlad Balance patch. The Dudley's dungeon strip for 30 November 2006 (via Wayback Machine) featured several humorous attempts to remake Vlad; see also the comments for the 30 November and 1 December strips.\nVlad is a major vampire based mostly on the fictional , who is in turn based on the non-fictional Vlad , a 15th century Romanian prince.\nIn SporkHack he's been beefed up significantly, most notably by arming him with an artifact two-handed sword named Lifestealer that has similar properties to Stormbringer.\nGruntHack enhances Vlad's vital statistics (base level 28, base speed 24, stunning and confusion attacks) and give him a guaranteed thirsty spetum and a stack of cursed scrolls of teleportation.\nStrangely, in SLASH'EM there is also the distinct Count Dracula as a quest nemesis. So they are two monsters, derived from the same non-fictional Vlad .\nBULLET::::- A list of many humorous Vladsbanes from NAO games with 3.4.3\nBULLET::::- The Vlad Balance patch\n",
    "gelatinous cube": "Gelatinous cube\nThe gelatinous cube, , is an amoeboid monster in NetHack. Unlike the Dungeons & Dragons creature from which it is derived, it has no means to engulf the player; however, it still possesses the means to paralyze the unwary. The gelatinous cube possesses two different kinds of paralysis attacks: the paralyzing touch is a melee attack that can be protected against with high magic cancellation, while the other one is a passive attack that can be prevented by wearing a ring of free action or not engaging in melee combat. \nTheir corpses are acidic, but may also provide fire, cold, shock, or sleep resistance. Like all blobs, gelatinous cube corpses are considered vegan and can be eaten without breaking the conduct.\nGelatinous cubes are noteworthy in that, as they move, they will eat organic items they pass over and engulf most other items (exceptions being boulders or a punished player's iron ball and chain). The engulfed items are placed into the cube's inventory, making them useful for cleaning useless items out of a level. This also makes them the bane of stashes - if a cube eats a container, the container will be destroyed, though the items are recovered when the cube is slain.\nMonster cubes will respect and not eat a scroll of scare monster, but you can eat one while polymorphed into a cube. Eating a scroll of scare monster, a scroll of mail, a scroll labeled YUM YUM, or any other paper item gives special messages, but no additional effect.\n",
    "umber hulk": "Umber hulk\nAn umber hulk is a monster in \"NetHack\" and the sole member of the umber hulk monster class. It one of the few monsters that can tunnel naturally through rock, a trait it shares with rock moles and woodchucks. It also has a unique, non-reflectable gaze attack that can confuse anything they glare at, including itself if a mirror is applied towards it.\nUmber hulks are carnivorous, but also gain nutrition when tunneling; they are not metallivores like rock moles, though.\nIn addition to normal generation, umber hulks can be created by the summon nasties monster spell. An umber hulk is guaranteed to appear on the Plane of Earth.\nUmber hulks are the strongest tunneling monster encountered in the main dungeon, and move twice as fast as rock moles, though they are still much slower than even an unhasted player. Blinding yourself will protect you completely from the gaze of a hostile umber hulk; confusing it by applying a mirror also makes it somewhat less likely to turn that gaze on you. However, it can still hit decently hard.\nUmber hulks are generally utilized as pets or polyforms for their natural tunneling ability\u2014tame umber hulks combined with a magic whistle can easily eat a path through large maze levels such as Gehennom without requiring additional resources, such as the high power cost of a spell of dig, the valuable charges of a wand of digging, or bearing the weight of a pick-axe or dwarvish mattock. Hostile umber hulks can also be useful for tunneling purposes, but care must be taken to avoid becoming confused or killing them.\nAn umber hulk is an insectoid monster originating from \"Dungeons & Dragons\". It has mandibles, exoskeleton and antennae like a beetle, but two limbs like a primate, and walks in a semi-erect manner similar to a gorilla. It has four eyes\u2014two small and two large\u2014and uses them to confuse unfortunate creatures that see all four at once.\n",
    "acid blob": "Acid blob\nThe acid blob, , is an amoeboid monster in NetHack. It is the first acidic monster most players will encounter, and also likely the first amorphous monster as well. Acid blobs do no damage on their own, but have an acid-splashing passive attack that can corrode weapons and armor.\nAcid blob corpses are unique in that they are always fit for sacrifice, and do not become tainted from aging similar to lichen and lizard corpses, though they can still rot away. Eating an acid blob corpse will do 1d15 damage unless you are acid resistant; a tin of acid blob will not do any damage. Acid blob corpses are considered vegan-friendly.\nAcid blobs may be generated peaceful for neutral characters. Reading any scroll of create monster while confused will create at least 13 acid blobs.\nAcid blobs will act the same as any other hostile monster, but are ultimately harmless; however, attacking them poses a threat to an inexperienced and/or low-level player, and their amorphous forms allow them to ooze under doors and block a player's path.\nFor some early characters, it is best to dispatch them at a distance with disposable projectiles like rocks or non-iron projectiles, such as elven daggers. Wands and spells can work, but are better saved for more direct threats. If you have enough HP to survive a few splashes of acid, then use a disposable/non-iron weapon, attack bare-handed or simply kick them; the acid splash may still affect any non-corrodeproof iron armor. Past this point, acid blobs are little more than a nuisance that can occasionally erode weapons and armor if a player is careless in dispatching them, and even that annoyance is easily dealt with using corrode-proofed weapons and armor.\nAcid blob corpses have value both as long-lasting sacrifice fodder and a means of curing stoning; acid blob tins can also cure stoning without dealing acid damage, but may take too long to safely open unless blessed.\nLater in the game, players may employ confused readings of scrolls of create monster to fill up a dungeon level with acid blobs and prevent other monsters from reviving; this is a common method to take care of the Riders on the Astral Plane.\nExcept for the gelatinous cube, all other blobs, puddings, and oozes share the same entry:\n",
    "gremlin": "Gremlin\nThe gremlin, , is a NetHack monster. Getting them wet will cause them to divide into two gremlins with half the maximum HP as the original; they will actively seek moats and fountains to promote this process. Fountains will sometimes dry up when used by gremlins. In addition, at night they have the ability to steal intrinsics. They are vulnerable to light, and their flesh is poisonous.\nEach successful hit at night with the intrinsic-stealing attack has a 1/10 chance of picking a random intrinsic from the following list. The first intrinsic you have from the chosen one downward will be lost. If you have none of the intrinsics from the chosen one downward, nothing will be lost.\nBULLET::::- Fire resistance\nBULLET::::- Teleportitis\nBULLET::::- Poison resistance\nBULLET::::- Telepathy\nBULLET::::- Cold resistance\nBULLET::::- Invisibility\nBULLET::::- See invisible\nBULLET::::- Speed\nBULLET::::- Stealth\nBULLET::::- Protection\nBULLET::::- Aggravate monster\nThe game separately tracks intrinsics (from corpses, altar work, potions, wands) and extrinsics (from jewelry, armor, artifacts) and role/race properties. For example, if a gremlin steals poison resistance from a high-level monk or a hero in an alchemy smock, the hero will still resist poison as long as they do not drain levels or remove the smock.\nAdditionally, players that are polymorphed into clay golems are turned back to their original form. This occurs even if they have the unchanging property.\nThe attack is \"not\" affected by magic cancellation, though it can still be prevented by canceling the monster.\nWhen successfully used against other monsters, the special attack cancels them instead of stealing instrinsics. Clay golems are destroyed.\nNight is 22:00 - 05:59 server time.\nGremlins, uniquely among NetHack monsters, are harmed by sources of light:\nBULLET::::- Zapping a wand of light, reading a scroll of light, or casting the spell will do d5 damage to gremlins in the light radius.\nBULLET::::- Breaking a wand of light will do (1 + charges)d4 damage to gremlins in the blast radius.\nBULLET::::- Flashing an expensive camera will do d4 damage to gremlins caught in the flash.\nBULLET::::- Lit Sunsword does an extra d8 damage to gremlins (on top of the weapon's regular damage).\nOriginally, gremlins were mischievous creatures blamed for mechanical failures in aircraft in the RAF in the 1920s; they were popularized by children's author Roald Dahl and a related Disney animated short. The concept of gremlins that multiply in water and have a vulnerability to light comes from the 1984 movie, \"\".\nIf you find a Gremlin in a level with water or a fountain with telepathy, kill it quickly, or chances are you will end up having about 50 of them running around. This is especially bad for chaotics: the herd of gremlins will sometimes be generated peaceful, thus killing them inflicts a large hit on your alignment record.\nOn the other hand, if you find yourself with a tame gremlin but don't particularly want one, and have a polymorph trap handy, consider allowing it to split a few times so you can get more useful pets by polymorphing them. You will get a legion of 1HP pets that will mostly die as something (anything) lands a hit on them, but if you have enough of them, chances are some of them will survive and earn enough experience to become useful.\nFor ease of transit, levels with both water and lots of peaceful gremlins may need clearing. Pets with multiple attacks (such as a vrock created by polymorph or figurine) can be used to control the gremlin population without too much risk to the pet, especially if you have a magic whistle for levels with islands like Medusa's Island and Juiblex's Swamp.\nGremlins multiply normally in lethe water present in the lethe patch at the Lethe Gorge.\nGremlins multiply normally in lethe water. SLASH'EM has lethe water at the castle only.\nHere, gremlins are capable of stealing intrinsics always, but at night the chance is much higher.\n",
    "blue jelly": "Blue jelly\nThe blue jelly, , is a monster in NetHack. It is blind, sessile and cannot attack directly, but possesses a passive attack that deals cold damage.\nIf you attack a blue jelly in melee without killing it, and you do not have cold resistance, it will gain HP equal to half the damage it inflicts on you. Attacking it, even if you miss, may cause the blue jelly to divide in two. \"(\u201cThe blue jelly multiplies from your heat!\u201d)\".\nEating a blue jelly corpse is considered vegan and may convey cold resistance or poison resistance.\nAvoid attacking a blue jelly in melee unless you have cold resistance, as blue jellies are much tougher than might be expected, and their cold passive attack can be deadly to inexperienced players.. At their base level, they do (4+1)d6 damage, which gives a range of 5\u201330, and they can be generated at much higher levels. Ranged attacks are preferable, but make sure you have enough ranged weapons to finish the job\u2014you won't be able to retrieve that lovely stack of daggers until the jelly is dead.\nAs of 3.6.1, an aklys is a solid option that likely should be used first - at worst, the akyls will fail to return, but you will most likely do enough damage that you can kill the jelly with your remaining projectiles, potentially preserving valuable darts, wand charges or other items.\nBlue jellies are frequently employed for boulder forts, stashes, and the like since they are completely immobile.\n",
    "quivering blob": "Quivering blob\nThe quivering blob, , is a monster that appears in NetHack. It is one of the few amoeboid monsters without a damaging passive attack.\nLike all blobs, quivering blob corpses are considered vegan; they provide 100 nutrition, with a 33% chance of conferring poison resistance.\nQuivering blobs are extremely slow, and cause only minor damage with their infrequent touch attacks; between this and their lack of passive attack, they are generally considered to be no threat and are easily dispatched, making them a fairly low-risk source of poison resistance. \nBULLET::::- Perhaps unusually as monsters go, there are no special cases in the source code with respect to quivering blobs; all the information about them is given by their status as a blob, and their stats.\nExcept for the gelatinous cube, all other blobs, puddings, and oozes share the same entry:\n",

(A wand of striking is likely to miss the ant; it is a poor choice.)\nBULLET::::- Zapping an unidentified wand at a monster can be risky, but might pay off if you can use it to attack or get away.\nBULLET::::- If you've exhausted all possible options, try reading an unknown scroll. It may be a scroll of teleportation or earth. This is even riskier. Cursed scrolls and spellbooks can sometimes cause teleportation, but cannot be relied upon to do so.

As mentioned previously, they are one of the top causes of death on the NAO server.\nSoldier ants are poisonous to eat.\nThe fire ant, , is another member of Team Ant that causes the deaths of many an inexperienced player due to its high intrinsic speed and fire attacks; although not as immediately deadly as the soldier ant, the fire damage poses a threat to the player's inventory and armor as well.\nThere are several strategies for players who encounter ant swarms early in the game:\nBULLET::::- Ants are much faster than most low-level characters, so try to get into a corridor as soon as possible so you don't get surrounded.\nBULLET::::- Use a long-range weapon (such as a wand of magic missile) because it has a chance of killing more than one of the now lined-up monsters.\nBULLET::::- If you are skilled enough with a ranged weapon, firing multiple projectiles also has a chance of killing multiple lined-up ants.\nBULLET::::- Run to the stairway (hopefully, the stairway up) as soon as the ant is spotted.\nBULLET::::- If possible, disable the ant (perhaps with a wand of sleep) before fleeing.\nBULLET::::- Since ants are very fast, use any escape items or spells that will help you get to the stairs more quickly.\nBULLET::::- Close doors to block the ants, if you are strong. Weak characters might not be able to close the door in time.\nBULLET::::- Another option is to engrave Elbereth. Ants are frightened by Elbereth.\nBULLET::::- A fleeing ant is less deadly than one attacking you.\nBULLET::::- With Elbereth, you can use the spare turns to attack the ant in melee, throw weapons, cast spells, or find an escape route.\nBULLET::::- If you must fight them, attack the ant with your best items or spells.\nBULLET::::- Now might be the time to use your offensive wands against the ant. (A wand of striking is likely to miss the ant; it is a poor choice.)\nBULLET::::- Zapping an unidentified wand at a monster can be risky, but might pay off if you can use it to attack or get away.\nBULLET::::- If you've exhausted all possible options, try reading an unknown scroll. It may be a scroll of teleportation or earth. This is even riskier. Cursed scrolls and spellbooks can sometimes cause teleportation, but cannot be relied upon to do so. Use this strategy only as a last resort.\nBULLET::::- If you get away, don't return to the area until you're confident you can survive the conflict.\nGiant ant corpses are non-poisonous. Soldier ant corpses are poisonous and can grant poison resistance. Eating the corpse of a fire ant has a 20% chance of giving you the fire resistance intrinsic, and is a common source in the absence of red dragons and fire giants.\nSLASH'EM adds the snow ant, the cold-based version of the fire ant.\nThe soldier ant is a nickname given to s in real life. Although it is possible that humans have been killed by army or driver ants, it is extremely unlikely, as they are little bigger than ordinary ants. They do, however, travel in very large groups.\nFire ants are real ants. They are many species of fire ants. They are usually red/reddish, very aggressive and their sting (from their abdomen) feels like a burn.\n",
    "queen bee": "Queen bee\nThe queen bee, , is an insectoid monster in NetHack. Found only within beehives, they are exceedingly fast and can be deadly to an unprepared player, especially when the killer bees that surround them are taken into account.\nA beehive is part of the Wizard's Tower, and as such a queen bee will always be generated, along with her entourage of killer bees, unless you have decided to genocide either the specific glyph (blessed scroll of genocide) or the specific monster (uncursed scroll).\n",
    "minotaur": "Minotaur\nThe minotaur, , is an especially deadly NetHack monster. Minotaurs are notoriously difficult to kill and deal out incredible amounts of damage, leading to many deaths by their hands even by experienced players. They are also infamous for being one of the few monsters to ignore Elbereth.\nTo estimate how badly you can expect to be stomped, see armor class.\nMinotaurs are carnivorous. They cannot wear armor or wield weapons. They will open unlocked doors, but are stopped by locked doors and boulders, and, as they do not fly, all traps will affect them. Since they are not intelligent, they cannot make use of unicorn horns, amulets, potions of gain level, or unlocking tools.\nFortunately, they are not generated after level creation by the normal mechanism. There are zero, one, or two generated on each full-level maze. One also appears on the Ranger quest home level. They can also be summoned by the Summon nasties monster spell, and finally, as a valid polymorphable form, are an unlikely but nonetheless possible result for that gnome lord who jumped into a polymorph trap.\nA minotaur has a chance of getting a wand of digging (100% if on the Plane of Earth).\nSome minotaur-repellent ideas, roughly in decreasing order of effectiveness (the last three options are virtually last-ditch efforts):\nBULLET::::- Taming, from any source, is guaranteed to work. Minotaurs have zero magic resistance.\nBULLET::::- A minotaur is a worthy candidate for a wand of death charge. If not magic resistant or reflecting, be careful where you aim - fire in a panic and you might hit yourself with the rebound.\nBULLET::::- If a minotaur has interrupted your dig for victory, zap a wand of digging straight down (unless on the Castle level).\nBULLET::::- A very fast spellcaster, possibly armed with , might be able to keep at a safe distance and wear the minotaur down. Be careful not to get backed into a corner.\nBULLET::::- An expert archer or dagger-thrower can do the same thing.\nBULLET::::- Attack wands are another option; watch when they run out of charges. If the minotaur is in a maze, you can bounce rays off walls to get more hits in.\nBULLET::::- A wand of slow monster (or the equivalent spell) will reduce a minotaur's speed to 10. Any unencumbered character can outrun a monster with speed 10, and if you're forced to melee it, you'll only take about 2/3 as much damage.\nBULLET::::- Blind the minotaur before engaging it. That expensive camera will significantly reduce the minotaur's ability to land hits on you, and make it much easier to run away if you start taking damage.\nBULLET::::- Stand on a scroll of scare monster. This is 100% effective at scaring minotaurs, even if you are in Gehennom or the endgame. Be aware that minotaurs will walk over scrolls of scare monster that you are \"not\" standing on, and you will probably have to move at some point!\nBULLET::::- If you have free action, wield a potion of paralysis and smash it over the minotaur's head, buying yourself a few (approximately 3-12) turns to kill it, run, or prepare some of the other options mentioned here.\nBULLET::::- Build a boulder fort and take it down with ranged attacks.\nBULLET::::- Build an acid blob fort to buy yourself time to either dig down or combine inventory items (performing alchemy, or writing a scroll of taming).\nBULLET::::- Zap the minotaur with a wand of teleportation. You will probably have to deal with the minotaur later, though.\nBULLET::::- Zap the minotaur with a wand of sleep and run/dig/teleport. You will probably have to deal with the minotaur later, though.\nBULLET::::- Zap the minotaur with a wand of sleep and try to kill it in melee before it wakes back up. Make sure you have an escape item in case this doesn't work.\nBULLET::::- Engage the minotaur head-on. Unless you're well-kitted, this is probably a bad idea.\nBULLET::::- Throw a potion of paralysis at the minotaur, buying yourself a few free hits or a few turns to run. Thrown potions are quite likely to miss.\nMinotaurs can easily be tamed, but do not make viable pets by the time you encounter them. On the upside, they have strong attacks and can get up to 22 hit dice with 176 hit points. On the downside, they cannot make use of any equipment, have no resistances, can be swallowed by digesters, and will eat shapeshifter corpses. However, a spellcaster that can reliably cast may want to tame minotaurs simply to avoid fighting them.\nAs of version 4.0.0 of UnNetHack, minotaurs respect Elbereth.\nMinotaurs gain intrinsic resistance to death magic, so they will not be vulnerable to the wand of death.\nSince version 3.0.5, minotaurs have not been affected by Elbereth. In versions from 3.0.5 to 3.4.3, they were also not affected by the scroll of scare monster. This behavior was explained in the following way:\nVersion 3.0.8 made it impossible to produce wands of wishing from polymorph; in 3.1.0, this note was removed but minotaurs continued to ignore Elbereth. This behavior remains unchanged in vanilla NetHack..\nIn 3.6.0 and above, minotaurs do respect scrolls of scare monster, but only while the player is standing on the scroll.\nThe encyclopedia entry is correct about the myth. \nPoseidon, to punish Minos, king of Crete, made the queen fall in love with a bull. She ordered the construction of a hollow wooden cow so that she could mate with the bull. The child that was born had the body of a human and the head of a bull. As it grow up, it became ferocious and a man eater. Minos was forced to keep it alive in the labyrinth and feed it.\nThe etymology of Minotaur is from Minos the king and \"taur\" meaning bull in greek.\n",
    "titan": "Titan\nThe titan is a monster in NetHack. It is infamous for its guaranteed appearance on one of four variants of Medusa's Island and can be difficult for a player at that stage of the game to defeat due to its tendency to summon large swarms of monsters. Titans are therefore one of two significant obstacles on the average dig for victory (the other being minotaurs).\nTitans are generally peaceful for lawful characters, although this is not guaranteed. They are hostile to neutral and chaotic characters.\nThey can throw boulders (and have a 50% chance of starting with one). They cannot wear suits, shirts or cloaks, but can use all other armor, and can wield two-handed weapons unless wearing a shield.\nThe greatest threat titans pose is the ability to summon monster swarms, so be prepared for any nasty to spawn. Note that titans \"cannot\" be genocided, so don't even try it if you're in trouble. Titans do respect Elbereth, which can be a lifesaver. It will not, however, stop them from continuing to summon nasties, including the Elbereth-ignoring minotaurs, elf-lords, elvenkings, captains, and couatls. One can also try taming them, although getting a charm monster spell past their high magic resistance can be difficult.\nYet another option is to put them to sleep. A wand will sometimes miss due to their low armor class, but is usually worth trying several times. Titans' magic resistance will make spells of sleep difficult. Potions are a good choice.\nCockatrice corpses are an excellent way to rid yourself of a titan, provided you have gloves. A titan may even summon a cockatrice for you!\nThe combination of spell-casting, a decent melee attack, and excellent speed, as well as low AC and high magic resistance makes titans superb fighters, especially if you equip them with a powerful weapon and strong armor. Titans are obtainable from polymorph traps, and contest balrogs as the best monster obtainable by such means. One drawback is that they do eat, though you will be grateful of this the next time you fall down a shaft and find all your pet titans remain tame. But be prepared to handle a titan confused from hunger!\nTitans can be genocided in SLASH'EM.\n",
    "troll": "Troll\nTrolls are a class of monsters in \"NetHack\". They are notable because the corpses of dead trolls will revive (similar to the Riders). For that reason, trolls are one of the more annoying monsters. Trolls can also make use of polearms\u2014they can pound with one at the same range as a character who is Skilled in polearms. They have a 50% chance of being generated with either a ranseur, partisan, glaive, or spetum.\nA troll, , is also the least powerful monster of this class. Other types of troll include ice trolls, rock trolls, water trolls, and Olog-hai.\nPlayers polymorphed into trolls should be careful around cockatrices; attempting to attack a cockatrice in troll form will cause you to bite it and turn to stone.\nGenerally speaking, for well armed characters, trolls do not pose a major threat, but preventing them from reviving can be tricky. There are a large number of ways to kill a troll permanently, many of which involve putting the corpse inside something:\nBULLET::::- Eat the corpse. It will disappear only when you are finished. During the meal, it may revive, or you may be interrupted, or you may become unconscious from rotten food. This is a readily available option as long as you are not satiated.\nBULLET::::- Let a pet eat the corpse. It will disappear as soon as the pet starts to eat, though this option is only available if you have a carnivorous pet.\nBULLET::::- Tin the corpse. This is the easiest option for those with a tinning kit.\nBULLET::::- Lock the corpse in a container.

    "olog-hai": "Troll\nTrolls are a class of monsters in \"NetHack\". They are notable because the corpses of dead trolls will revive (similar to the Riders). For that reason, trolls are one of the more annoying monsters. Trolls can also make use of polearms\u2014they can pound with one at the same range as a character who is Skilled in polearms. They have a 50% chance of being generated with either a ranseur, partisan, glaive, or spetum.\nA troll, , is also the least powerful monster of this class. Other types of troll include ice trolls, rock trolls, water trolls, and Olog-hai.\nPlayers polymorphed into trolls should be careful around cockatrices; attempting to attack a cockatrice in troll form will cause you to bite it and turn to stone.\nGenerally speaking, for well armed characters, trolls do not pose a major threat, but preventing them from reviving can be tricky. There are a large number of ways to kill a troll permanently, many of which involve putting the corpse inside something:\nBULLET::::- Eat the corpse. It will disappear only when you are finished. During the meal, it may revive, or you may be interrupted, or you may become unconscious from rotten food. This is a readily available option as long as you are not satiated.\nBULLET::::- Let a pet eat the corpse. It will disappear as soon as the pet starts to eat, though this option is only available if you have a carnivorous pet.\nBULLET::::- Tin the corpse. This is the easiest option for those with a tinning kit.\nBULLET::::- Lock the corpse in a container. Useful for trolls generated in throne rooms, though they may revive while being carried to their destination. Nesting a container more than 2 levels deep will also prevent reviving, as will a bag of holding 97.5% of the time. You will receive the message \"You feel less hassled\" when a troll corpse stored in a container fails to revive.\nBULLET::::- Just keep killing the troll. Each time you do, there is approximately a 25% chance that it will not revive.\nBULLET::::- Place the corpse in an ice box. The revival countdown will be paused.

    "bat": "Bat\nThe bat is a class of NetHack monster represented by the overall symbol . They are all extremely fast and can fly, as one would expect.\nThe bat, , is also the weakest monster of this class. Other bats include the and the . The , a bird, also uses the same symbol.\nEating a bat corpse is a bad idea. It stuns you for 30 turns, and the corpse itself is worth only 20 nutrition. Pets, however, are for some reason immune to stunning, and can easily eat bat corpses.\nBats grow up to be giant bats.\nPlayers polymorphed into bats are permanently stunned.\nAll monsters have slightly erratic movement. If the monster decides to move, there is a 1 in 3 chance that the monster will fly in a random direction, rather than approach you. If you are fleeing from a bat, this might provide a moment of relief. If you stay in melee range, the monster will also stay in melee range and continue to attack you.\nInterestingly, any bat, giant bat or vampire bat generated in Gehennom is made slightly faster than normal. Presumably because nothing moves like a \"bat [on its way] out of hell\".\nBats and giant bats both appear early in the game, and the giant bats are individually more dangerous. Bats normally appear in small groups.\nThe bats of NetHack stay within melee range, making them easy targets for many players.\nWhen eaten, bat and giant bat corpses cause the player to be stunned (for 30 and 60 turns, respectively). Vampire bat corpses are poisonous, while ravens are safe to eat.\nBats have annoyed adventurers seeking the Amulet of Yendor since the days of Hack, back when eating a dead bat would cause confusion because stun was not yet implemented.\nReal life bats have echolocation, employing sound to discover the positions of things in the dark. NetHack does not implement echolocation, though the biodiversity patch does, at least if you polymorph into a bat. \n",
    "vampire bat": "Vampire bat\nThe vampire bat, , is a monster in NetHack. It is the most powerful variety of bat. Despite its name, it cannot drain life the way a vampire can, but it does have a poisonous bite.\nIts corpse is poisonous, but unlike the corpses of other species of bat, it does not stun the player.\nAs of version 3.6.0, a vampire bat may actually be a shapeshifted vampire or vampire lord, and resurrect in that form after being killed.\nPlayers polymorphed into vampire bats\nBULLET::::- are permanently stunned.\nBULLET::::- will polymorph into vampires when the player polymorphs without polymorph control.\nA vampire bat can be identified as a polymorphed vampire by using any means of probing (wand of probing, stethoscope, attack with Magicbane); the message will show a \"shapeshifter.\" Attacking a vampire bat with a silver weapon will sear it if it is really a vampire.\nVampire bats are real, and common to the American Southwest as well as Central and South America. There are three distinct species of vampire bat, and are the only animals known to feed primarily or solely on the blood of other animals.\n",
    "stalker": "Stalker\nThe stalker, , is a monster in NetHack. They are always generated invisible, and are therefore referred to as invisible stalkers. Eating stalker meat, whether from the corpse or from a tin, will either turn the player temporarily invisible for 50-149 turns (if they are not already invisible) or permanently invisible with the see invisible intrinsic (if they are already invisible, temporarily or otherwise). When wearing a Mummy wrapping you are not invisible and therefore are not eligible to receive the see invisible intrinsic or the permanent invisibility intrinsic. Killing and eating two stalkers in rapid succession is one of the most reliable ways of obtaining these intrinsics. It should be noted that eating stalker meat in the heat of battle is not generally recommended as it will stun you upon consumption. \nPlayers polymorphed into stalkers are permanently stunned.\nThe stalker is based on a Dungeons & Dragons monster known formally as the \"invisible stalker\". As most versions of Hack and NetHack have automatically prefixed monster names with \"invisible\" when actions that refer to an invisible monster have been involved, using the full name would result in the egregious \"invisible invisible stalker\"; therefore the prefix \"invisible\" was dropped.\nNevertheless, for a very long time the symbol was used to represent the stalker (I meaning \"invisible\"). This changed in NetHack 3.3.0, when the symbol was appropriated to indicate the last known position of any invisible monster. The use of the symbol for elementals reflects the fact that they are really a species of air elemental.\n",
    "djinni": "Djinni\nThe djinni, (plural djinn), is a monster that appears in \"NetHack\".\nDespite sharing a glyph with major demons, the djinn does not share any of their characteristics. Djinn are poison resistant and immune to stoning; despite being poisonous to eat, this almost never comes up, as they do not leave corpses.\nDjinn are only generated on the Plane of Air, where three are guaranteed; additional djinn can be generated elsewhere by rubbing a magic lamp or drinking a smoky potion. A djinni generated this way might be tame, peaceful, or hostile - in some cases it might simply disappear, sometimes granting a wish first. A tame djinni makes a powerful pet in the early game\u2014it is intelligent and will use weapons\u2014but a wish is almost always more useful. Blessing the lamp or potion will increase the odds of receiving a wish.\nA player or monster may not polymorph into a djinni.\nEarly-game characters will want to be especially sure that any magic lamps they find are blessed, in order to minimize the chance of spawning a hostile djinni and subsequently dying. A particularly paranoid player may also want to save potential wishes from lamps or potions until they have sufficient armor or weapons to handle such a worst-case scenario; the djinn only has one attack, but can hit for up to 16 base damage.\nThe following messages can occur when you release a djinni from a magic lamp, or one is released from a smoky potion.\nNetHack-- and SLASH 6 (precursors of SLASH'EM) and SlashTHEM add three more types of genie, all from \"Dungeons & Dragons\":\nBULLET::::- The efreeti (), from the Plane of Fire\nBULLET::::- The dao ( in NetHack-- 3.1.3, in SLASH 6), from the Plane of Earth\nBULLET::::- The marid ( in NetHack-- 3.1.3, in SLASH 6), from the Plane of Water\nOf note is that the efreeti and marid are referenced in regular \"NetHack\" as hallucinatory monsters.\nNone of the genies are randomly generated. In SLASH 6, any one of the four types can be found in a potion or magic lamp, with the same probabilities of granting wishes, etc. as a djinni in regular NetHack. (The code for randomly selecting one of the four types is present in the SlashTHEM source as well, but commented out.) Despite the elemental affinities of the three new genies, according to the \"D&D\" source, djinn remain the only species that are guaranteed to appear on any of the Elemental Planes. (In NetHack-- 3.0.10, only the djinni can be found in a potion or lamp, and the Elemental Planes do not exist, so it is unclear how a player can find the other three types, apart from wishing for a figurine or a statue.)\nLike the djinni, these genies are not considered demons and so are not harmed by silver. They are almost identical to the djinni, except in their names, glyphs, and alleged homes. The only significant differences are that in SLASH 6 the efreeti resists fire and electrical damage (only fire in NetHack-- 3.0.10) and the marid resists cold damage. In NetHack-- 3.0.10 the dao phases like an earth elemental while the other three genies can fly; in SLASH 6 all four are flyers. All four genies have the same 2d8 physical attack.\n",
    "snake": "Snake\nSnakes are a class of monster in NetHack represented by the overall symbol . They are generally poisonous and have the capability to hide under items dropped on the ground.\nThe snake, , is also the second-weakest member of this class (next to the garter snake). It is poisonous if eaten.\nIf a snake is created during the initial level generation process, NetHack will generate a random item for the snake to hide under. This method of item generation accounts for a significant portion of the items in the archeologist quest.\nIn the dungeon you will encounter the following kinds of snakes:\nSnake also refers to the grouping of body parts for the forms of snakes.

    "xan": "Xan\nThe xan, , is a monster in NetHack. Its unique attack targets your legs, resulting in a wounded leg if the attack succeeds. Worn iron shoes or low boots protect you 40% of the time; any other boots protect you 80% of the time. A canceled xan cannot injure your legs, and instead \"nuzzles\" them.\nXans are capable of flight, and their corpse is poisonous to eat.\nBefore NetHack 3.6.3, riding, flying, or levitating would prevent a xan from wounding your legs. As xans themselves fly, this was considered a bug and fixed.\nThe xan is based on a mythical Mayan mosquito from , a Mayan book.\n",
    "shrieker": "Shrieker\nThe shrieker is a monster in NetHack. While it has no attacks and moves very slowly, its shriek can aggravate monsters and has a 10% chance) to summon a random monster somewhere on the level. The summoned monster has a chance of being a purple worm; the explanation given for this is that purple worms enjoy consuming shriekers and are attracted by their shriek. #Chatting with a shrieker will also cause it to shriek; this aggravates monsters, but cannot summon any. The shrieker corpse also gives a 20% chance of poison resistance, and is safe to eat (unless they are rotten); further, as the shrieker is considered a fungus, consuming a shrieker corpse does not break the vegan or vegetarian conducts.\nThe line \"The shrieker shrieks.\" has gained a reputation as being one of the most memorable lines in NetHack.\nSome shriekers are guaranteed on the last level of the Caveman Quest.\nAccording to \"Dungeons & Dragons\", the shrieker is a large purple fungus.\nShriekers in SLASH'EM, like all except lichens, may rise from the dead. Additionally, they are incapable of summoning purple worms but are slightly more likely to summon a monster with a shriek ( chance instead of ). The first change may be because two other monsters, the squealer and the mobat, have the same shriek in SLASH'EM. Shriekers are also immune to death rays.\n",
    "hobgoblin": "Hobgoblin\nThe hobgoblin, , is a monster in NetHack. They are relatively weak and slow and not a significant threat.\nThey are also frequently found in throne rooms. \nThey will be generated with an orcish helm 50% of the time, and they also have a 50% chance of receiving a weapon, which has an equal chance of being a scimitar or an orcish dagger. \nFor in-game purposes hobgoblins are orcs including being subject to the effects of Sting and Orcrist. Their corpses are useful for orc characters since they can be sacrificed to convert altars to the chaotic alignment, as well as the other benefits of same-race sacrifices.\n",
    "goblin": "Goblin\nA goblin, , is likely to be among the very first monsters you meet, and often carries an orcish helm and an orcish dagger (50% chance of each). They are not a significant threat, unless they are armed with a deadly wand, though that is an unlikely occurrence. They are usually peaceful to chaotic players.\nFor in-game purposes goblins are orcs, which includes being subject to the effects of Sting and Orcrist.\nTheir corpses are useful for orc characters since they can be sacrificed to convert altars to the chaotic alignment.\nNeutral players should make sure that they kill goblins themselves, because they are one of the few monsters in the very early game that are not neutral. Killing (hostile) crossaligned monsters increases your alignment record and makes prayer possible, while killing coaligned monsters (newt, lichen...) gives only experience that is often unwanted at that stage of the game. This is especially important for strategies which require a low level (like protection racket) or conducts that require much prayer (like vegetarian).\n",
    "hill orc": "Hill orc\nThe hill orc, , is the weakest form of orc normally found in \"NetHack\".\nHill orcs almost always appear in large groups. They frequently carry scimitars or orcish daggers, and wear orcish helms. The Orcish Town variant of Minetown features large numbers of named hill orcs, who can also be encountered elsewhere in the Gnomish Mines and the main branch, and they will often have looted items such as keys, candles and depleted wands in their inventory.\nHill orc numbers may be formidable and pose a problem for unprepared characters, but they are easy to defeat individually. Hill orcs usually mark one of the first instances where you will have to use crowd control strategies, such as drawing them into a corridor so that only one of them can attack you at a time. Be wary if any of them have scrolls or wands on hand.\nHill orcs make a decent source of food for a starting character, providing 200 nutrition; their corpses also make for good fodder for sacrifice if you can keep them close enough to an altar. While this applies to most monsters, orcish characters will especially appreciate them\u2014they lack penalties for cannibalism and stand to gain a lot more from same-race sacrifice, including maximizing Luck and summoning peaceful demon lords and foocubi.\nThe Orctown altar in particular may be worth converting for orcish characters for this reason, especially after procuring the luckstone from Mines' End. Make sure to convert it (with an ordinary sacrifice) \"before\" sacrificing any orcs, as you will lose Luck if the altar is unaligned; still, losing Luck may be preferable to letting the corpse rot and wasting a chance to get one more foocubus.\n",
    "mordor orc": "Mordor orc\nThe Mordor orc, , is a form of orc found in \"NetHack\". They are slightly stronger than hill orcs, but much slower.\nMordor orcs have a 2/3 chance of being generated with each of the following: a scimitar, an orcish shield, a knife, and an orcish chain mail. They also have the standard 50% chance of starting with an orcish helm.\nThe Orcish Town variant of Minetown features large numbers of named Mordor orcs inside the town walls, and they can also be encountered elsewhere in the Gnomish Mines and the main branch, often with looted Minetown items such as keys, candles and depleted wands.\nThe larger pool of equipment Mordor orcs can be generated with mean that, on average, Mordor orc hordes generally makes for a more difficult fight than against a group of hill orcs. However, the same strategies still apply and will likely prove just as effective; still, the player will want to be slightly more cautious and perhaps better armored.\nAs with other orcs, Mordor orc corpses can be a decent source of nutrition, and orcish characters may want to consider using them for sacrifices in Orcish Town after converting the altar using a non-orcish corpse.\n",
    "uruk-hai": "Uruk-hai\nThe Uruk-hai, , is a form of orc found in NetHack. They are stronger and faster than both hill orcs and Mordor orcs.\nThey are very similar to Mordor orcs, but carry and use some or all of the following: orcish cloaks, orcish short swords, iron shoes, orcish bows (with poisoned orcish arrows), and Uruk-hai shields. They have a 2/3 chance of starting with each, in addition to a 50% chance of an orcish helm, instead of the Mordor orc's equipment.\nThe Orcish Town variant of Minetown features large numbers of named Uruk-Hai, which can also be encountered elsewhere in the Gnomish Mines and the main branch, and they will often have looted items such as keys, candles and depleted wands in their inventory.\nLike other orcs, the larger pool of equipment makes hordes of Uruk-hai more difficult to fight, and Uruk-hai are the fastest orcs to be generated in groups. However, they can still be beaten using similar strategies, though the player will want to be decently armored and poison resistant to avoid a nasty instadeath.\nDrawing them into corridors is as viable as against any other group of orcs, but puts you at risk from poison arrow attacks; however, Uruk-hai lack poison resistance and are just as likely to hit each other with their arrows, if not more so. Facing an Uruk-Hai in melee will deter them from using their arrows, allowing you to pick them up and possibly use them against the rest once they are killed (possibly by their comrades). As with other orcs, Uruk-hai corpses can be a decent source of nutrition, and orcish characters may want to consider using them for sacrifices in Orcish Town.\n",
    "orc shaman": "Orc shaman\nThe orc shaman, , is a low level spell-casting monster in \"NetHack\". It is normally seen only casting psi bolt and healing.\nThe orc shaman is not created with a weapon like other orcs, but half the time it will have an orcish helm.\nIn addition to normal generation, orcish shamans may also appear in throne rooms, and two to six shamans will be generated near the desecrated temple in the Orcish Town variant of Minetown.\nSimilar to other low-level casters such as kobold shamans and gnomish wizards, orc shamans' spells frequently fail due to their low speed and low level; therefore, they are not a significant threat. Be careful not to get stunned while dealing with groups of monsters, however.\nLike other orcs, the corpse of an orc shaman is a good source of nutrition, and make for worthwhile sacrifices in Orcish Town, especially as an orcish character. \n",
    "orc-captain": "Orc-captain\nThe orc-captain, , is the strongest form of orc that appears in NetHack.\nUnlike their brethren, the orc-captain is never randomly generated in groups, and will start with the equipment of either a Mordor orc or Uruk-hai. One or more orc-captains will be generated inside the town walls of Orctown; in games that contain Orctown, a named orc-captain is also guaranteed to be found in Mines' End. This orc captain has a single name, signifying leadership of their clan, and will always have a shiny ring in addition to whatever extra Minetown loot they are generated with.\nHill orcs, Uruk-hai, Mordor orcs and ordinary orcs can all grow up to be orc-captains.\nWhile the orc-captain is not significantly stronger than a Mordor orc or Uruk-hai in terms of base stats, their ability to attack twice per turn can offset their low speed and deal unexpected damage to a player lacking in AC. It is thus best to face them at a distance, but their starting inventory may contain an orcish bow and poisoned orcish arrows; be sure to have poison resistance, especially if you are raiding Orctown. Fortunately, they are not poison resistant themselves, and orcs may also hit their comrades with the arrows; a patient player could use this knowledge to outwit and defeat the captain.\n",
    "yeti": "Yeti\nThe yeti is a monster that appears in NetHack. It is an apelike creature that is dangerous and must be dealt with carefully; while it cannot grab the player like a carnivorous ape, the yeti moves quicker than the largest ape, and does extra damage by biting.\nEating a yeti corpse has a 33% chance of providing the player with cold resistance.\nAlthough a yeti is rather quick, with a bit of preparation one can safely deal with it from a distance. Just like most other creatures, you can engrave Elbereth to scare it off. Ranged attacks are also effective in dealing with yetis safely; because they are susceptible to spell damage, even a mediocre spellcaster can kill a yeti with a few uses of the spell.\nThe Yeti, or Abominable Snowman, is a cryptozoological animal not recognized by science.

Furthermore, its speed and its ability to follow you from one level to another can make it difficult to escape.

    "master kaen": "Master Kaen\nKaen is just as powerful an opponent in 3.6.0 as he is in previous versions, but scrolls of scare monster now affect him. Therefore the easiest way to deal with him is to drop a scare monster scroll on the upstairs as soon as you arrive on his level. He will wake up and teleport to you, but he will be unable to attack you directly or flee upstairs, and he will not move away or cast spells (except possibly to heal himself). You will then be able to beat him to death in a matter of turns, preferably using F to ensure you stay on your square. Watch out for other monsters zapping wands of fire and possibly burning the scroll from under you.\nBecause of this new vulnerability, a Monk equipped with one or two scare monster scrolls can probably complete the Quest once it is unlocked, and does not need to wait until after finishing the Castle.\nIn addition, the Eyes of the Overworld do not grant magic resistance by simply carrying them anymore, so he is vulnerable to death magic, if not generated with a cloak of magic resistance.\nKaen is incredibly ferocious in a straight-up fight. Fortunately, he has weaknesses, and a wise Monk will exploit them \u2013 in the words of Sun Tsu, \"You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the enemy's weak points.\" Kaen's weaknesses include his predictable behavior (teleporting to the upstair to heal), and his lack of key resistances (sleep, level drain, and disintegration). The strategies listed below generally strive to play upon these weaknesses.\nEven with a good game plan, you may find Kaen a deadly opponent. You will want a very low AC to degrade his attacks (\u221220 is comfortable; you may get by with less), enough HP to survive multiple rounds of combat against him (200+), and a very high Luck (remember the altar you get on the first Quest level) to ensure that you are able to hit him. All of this \u2013 and the strength of the other enemies you face on the Quest \u2013 indicates postponing this battle until you have had enough time to prepare for it. Generally, you will be strong enough after you have finished the Castle and retrieved the luckstone from Mines' End.\nWield or throw a potion of paralysis while wearing a ring of free action or zap him with the sleep spell or wand. Make sure you can use this method multiple times to ensure his immobility \u2013 you may miss, or he may wake up before you finish killing him.\nSleep is a keyword to defeat him even at level 14 \u2013 it is difficult to overstate the power of this lowly spell against Kaen. After rendering him helpless, be sure to hit him hard. Mjollnir is an excellent choice if you have it, as are the martial arts at Grand Master skill level. But one or two of the stronger attack wands, such as lightning, fire, or cold, will work nicely as well. About 12 shots total should suffice, again assuming your luck is sufficiently high and you don't have too many misses.\nA scroll of earth (preferably blessed) will create a safe barrier around you that Kaen can not cross. You may then use any ranged attacks such as spells, wands or missiles (excluding force bolt/wand of striking, which will destroy the boulders). As Kaen lacks long-range attacks, your only hazards will be the xorns and elementals, which can phase through the rocks (though xorns and elementals both respect Elbereth), and any attack wands which might be randomly generated and used by a monster. You will have to cope with his ability to port to upstair and heal himself, and escape upstairs to the next level \u2013 so building a fort on the upstair yourself is a good approach.\nUse the spell until he croaks. It is a good idea to do this on the level above and when he teleports away (to heal the modest HP damage that drain life does on top of the draining effect), go downstairs to heal yourself, preferably on a burned Elbereth. Eidolos uses this method for his instructional ttyrec posted on RGRN. The ttyrec can be found here.\nUse fireproof water walking boots while fire resistant or levitate over the lava and use ranged attacks and attack wands. At a distance, Kaen only casts the heal self and create insects spells. Beware of losing your ability to levitate (e.g. lightning destroying your ring)! If you levitate over lava, Master Kaen cannot reach you.\nAlthough Master Kaen gains magic resistance from the quest artifact and is thus immune to wands of death, he is not immune to disintegration. Polymorphing into a black dragon and using #monster can allow you to kill him very quickly and easily, though it's important to note that his exceptionally low AC gives him a decent chance of dodging the breath attack. Because of his AC, it's safest to attack him under the assumption that you will miss the first few shots, and thus have positioned yourself at an appropriate distance from him. If you are reduced to 0 HP in dragon form, you will revert to your original form, and should have a backup plan of escape (or attack) ready. To be extra safe, polymorphing can be combined with the levitation strategy mentioned above because of the dragon form's natural flight, though flying over lava as a dragon can be risky as if the polymorph wears off, you'll lose the dragon's flying ability and die in the lava, unless you have some form of backup levitation/flight that isn't removed by the polymorph. Alternatively, you can combine the polymorph with the boulder fort strategy, which is less risky but requires more preparation.\nFight Kaen mano-a-mano. Not recommended. Master Kaen has a higher base damage than any other monster, resulting in very stable and impressive damage, compounded by the monk's high AC. You are therefore opposing his strengths with your weaknesses. Sufficiently advanced players have managed to do this, however. If you decide to go this route, make sure you have high health, low AC, and if at all possible, half physical damage.\nIn SLASH'EM, the potion of invulnerability turns Master Kaen from one of the most dangerous enemies into one of the least. Additionally, liberal use of techniques, such as Chi strike plus Elemental fist plus Pummel, has been known to kill Master Kaen in a single round of melee.\nBULLET::::- The Monk FAQ.\n",
    "dark one": "Dark One\nThe He is widely considered to be one of the easiest nemeses to defeat.\nHe normally carries the Eye of the Aethiopica and thus is also magic resistant. He is also covetous.\nIn 3.4.3 and earlier versions, if he carries the Eye (magic resistance), do not attempt to fight him with magic missile, force bolt or finger of death (nor their wand counterparts), which are completely ineffective. Novice players often fall for that error. From 3.6.0 on, the Eye must be worn to confer magic resistance, making those strategies viable.\nLike most covetous monsters, The Dark One should be fought from the upstairs, so that he cannot escape from you when he gets hurt. Preventing him from doing so could be a bit difficult without teleport control and a means of teleportation. A scroll of earth can be very useful in that case. Read it after you get to this level and move one boulder onto the stairs. Another possibility is to use a wand of teleportation on him and take his place on stairs.\nThe Dark One will place greater priority on healing than picking up the Eye, so if playing earlier versions of the game, you can approach him without waking him and hit him hard, e.g. with a reflected magic missile; he will teleport to the upstairs and leave the Eye for you to pick up. His level allows teleport, so you also can sneak attack him, grab the Eye of the Aethiopica after he teleports to the upstair, bag it, and teleport near to the upstair to unload with spells such as magic missile. The simplest way to defeat him afterward is, of course, zapping him with a wand of death or the finger of death spell; bagging the Eye is required in pre-3.6.0 versions because he may steal it back and become magic resistant.\nWhile he is not guaranteed to be able to summon nasties, if he is generated at level 16 or higher he will be able to do so. Be prepared to escape or strong enough to fight back in such a case. Even when vulnerable, attempting to drain him may prove too slow unless you're willing to accept the risk and try to drag him under level 16. The Dark One boasts a powerful repertoire of spells, so Sleep rays will also work well on him. Applying it every few turns will keep him helpless, saving players the bother of chasing him, and also stops him from casting his nasty spells.\nThe encyclopedia entry seems to imply that the Dark One is in fact Sauron, the chief antagonist of \"\".\n",

    "shade": "Shade\nA shade is an undead creature, created by black magic.\nThe shade's danger lies not in its damage, but in that it can remove intrinsic speed and (temporarily) extrinsic speed, and cause paralysis, leaving the player vulnerable to the attacks of other more dangerous creatures.\nIt cannot be harmed except with blessed or silver objects, magic, artifacts or a mirror (which does 1 point of damage and breaks; according to the source there is \"silver in the reflective surface\").\nShades can also move freely through solid rock, and can see invisible creatures.\nOrcus-town is the only place where shades appear.\nIf you've gotten this far without an alternative, you can use the Bell of Opening or any other silver item that isn't a silver arrow (unless you're shooting the arrows with your bow) against them. Unarmed gloveless combat with a silver ring equipped can also work, as can unarmed combat with blessed gloves (although this is very slow), or simply wielding the silver ring (regardless of whether or not you are wearing gloves). Of these alternatives, wielding a silver object is most advisable, because it gives you d20 silver damage as opposed to only d4 blessed damage and does not require you to remove your armor.

If either you or the pyrolisk are blind, the gaze has no effect; interestingly, the gaze attacks can work even if you are invisible, even though the pyrolisk cannot natuarally see invisible and it is still possible for them to miss.\nEating a pyrolisk corpse has a chance to convey fire resistance and poison resistance, with a 20% chance for each intrinsic.\nPyrolisks can be rendered completely harmless by blinding yourself, usually wearing a blindfold or towel, allowing you to dispatch them with ease. If you notice a pyrolisk in the area and have no means to blind yourself, stash your potions, scrolls and spellbooks in a sack or other container; if all else fails, drop them on the ground and be sure not to step too far away in case other monsters are nearby.\nAs a pet, the pyrolisk is generally not worthwhile, but its gaze attack does have the unique property of not provoking counterattacks or wake up sleeping monsters; it will also not attack peaceful monsters with the gaze unless it is confused or under conflict.\nThe pyrolisk's name is a contraction of \"pyr\" (Greek word \u03c0\u1fe6\u03c1 \"fire\") and \"basilisk\", a mythical snake-like monster closely related to the cockatrice. Pyrolisks come from \"Dungeons & Dragons\", where they are depicted as very similar in physical appearance to the cockatrice, with a rooster-like body, a reptilian tail and bat wings; pyrolisks have red tail feathers distinct from those of cockatrices.\n",
    "iron golem": "Iron golem\nThe iron golem is one of the tougher golems. Their breath is poisonous and can drain your strength.\nLightning slows them, and fire heals them - possibly by welding in their dents. They are hurt by rust monsters, and rust traps will instantly destroy them. If you are polymorphed into an iron golem when you step into a rust trap then you will take damage equal to your monster form's maximum hp, killing that form and reverting you to your natural form. The half physical damage extrinsic applies.\nWhen killed, an iron golem's corpse will be some number of the infamous iron chains, widely considered one of the most useless items in NetHack - although some players do find the occasional odd job for one. As iron chains are quite rare, it is worth consulting that entry when you dispatch an iron golem.\nOn creation, they have a chance of a battle axe or a two-handed sword or a bow and 3-14 arrows or a longsword or a lucern hammer or (64% chance) nothing.

    "rock mole": "Rock mole\nThe rock mole is a monster that appears in \"NetHack\". It is a rodent that can dig tunnels through the dungeon. They are able to eat anything metal, including amulets and some rings, as well as zorkmids. Sometimes they will even eat the iron spikes out of pits! Somewhat surprisingly, they cannot actually eat rocks or stones outside of variants.\nRock moles pick up gems they find buried in the walls. If you leave a rock mole alone for a while and then kill it, you can pick up the fruits of its mining. They will eat the gold pieces that also tend to be buried in walls, though. If you find a rock mole in a treasure zoo, it is wise to kill it quickly before it eats all the gold.\nYou can remove punishment by getting a rock mole to eat your ball and chain.\nPlayers polymorphed into rock moles can try eating jewelry. However, polymorphing into a xorn also allows for this, and xorns are generally better polymorph forms.\nIn Slash'EM Extended, polymorphing into a rock mole allows you to eat a loadstone, even if it is cursed.\nHere, rock moles have the lithivore attribute that allows them to eat stone and other lithic materials.\n",
    "electric eel": "Electric eel\nThe electric eel, , is a sea monster in \"NetHack\". Like its cousin, the giant eel, it has a drowning attack that can result in a potential two-move instadeath; it also has a shocking bite attack that can destroy wands and rings. Electric eels are oviparous; if you polymorph into a female electric eel, you can use the #sit command to lay an egg.\nEating an electric eel corpse has a 47% chance of conveying shock resistance. \nElectric eels are not randomly generated, but are a common sight in swamp rooms.\nSix electric eels are guaranteed on the titan variant of Medusa's Island, and eight are guaranteed on the Plane of Water.\nElectric eel attacks are especially concerning, as their shocking bite can destroy a ring of levitation being used to cross any moats or other large bodies of water, instantly drowning the victim even without using its dedicated attack. As with giant eels and other sea monsters, dispatch electric eels at a range outside of their reach to minimize danger, and use any monster-locating method, e.g. telepathy or warning, to make sure none of them get the jump on you. The usual safeguards against drowning attacks apply, e.g. a non-cursed oilskin cloak prevents grabbing, and having breathlessness or using a swimming polymorph form prevents drowning; a wand of teleportation can reliably warp them away even on non-teleport levels.\nElectric eels are most dangerous in the Plane of Water, where the player is all but forced into proximity to them and the eels can close in engraving is impossible, and the wand of cold and cone of cold spell are rendered unusable, as is the scroll of earth. Other methods, such as wands of teleport and levitation that can be stopped at will, are still viable. A scare tool such as a tooled horn, bugle, or leather drum will not fail because they have 0 MR. However, many players prefer to not take chances and instead used a blessed scroll of genocide to wipe out all right after entering the plane.\nDespite being a solid source of shock resistance, with the third-highest chance after storm giants and blue dragons, other sources may be preferred since electric eel corpses usually end up stuck in the water. They are easiest to retrieve in swamps; for example, the player can either evaporate the water and enter from the resulting pit, or freeze the square and any adjacent tiles of water and then dig out the corpse. \n",

    "leocrotta": "Leocrotta\nA leocrotta is a very fast, hard-hitting monster that can easily maul a mid- or low-level player. Often appearing before a character can be fully prepared, they're a common cause of death.\nLow-level characters, especially those that don't specialize in attacks, are well advised to escape using any means possible. Strong ranged attacks are helpful but leocrottas are very fast and may be able to close the gap before they can be put down. Leocrottas respect Elbereth so engraving or burning that can be effective.\nLeocrottas have no resistances so wands of cold, fire and lightning can kill them very quickly. As with the other quadrupeds, putting a leocrotta to sleep is an effective tactic if you have the means to do so.\nIf you're forced into melee combat with a leocrotta, a high damage weapon and decent AC is prefered. Because leocrottas get so many attacks per turn a small improvement in AC can give a big reduction in damage taken. Fighting from the stairs and walking to a different level to escape and heal is a good idea.\nThe leocrotta is derived from the Dungeons and Dragons Leucrotta, itself derived from the crocotta (or corocotta, crocuta, leucrocotta) of Indian/Ethiopian folklore.\nThe folkloric crocotta is a kind of evil dog/wolf/hyena, while the D&D leucrotta is an evil, ugly mix of a stag, lion, and badger, having a lion's body, badger's head, and stag's cloven-hoofed legs.\nWhen #chatted to, like the Aleax, \"The leocrotta imitates you.\" In ancient myth, the leucrocotta could simulate speech to call shepherds by their names to ambush them.\nBULLET::::- Depiction of a Leucrotta\n",

    "guard": "Guard\nThe guard is an exceedingly rare human monster in \"NetHack\" that will only appear occasionally if a player is in one of the dungeon's many vaults. They are under the employment of Croesus, and are the source of the footsteps you may hear on some levels, indicating there is a vault on that floor. Guards are mercenaries that are very similar to Yendorian Army soldiers, and can even be bribed.\nReviving a guard's corpse will produce a human zombie instead. Figurines of a guard cannot be wished for, and you will instead receive a figurine of a random monster.\nAs mercenaries, guards follow similar generation mechanisms to soldiers and watchmen for armor and weapons; see that article for more details.\nLike previously indicated, guards are not randomly generated, and only appear if the player waits around while within a vault, creating an opening in the vault wall or the outside solid rock for them to stand in. Vault guard generation increments the born counter, but does not respect extinction; while there is no limit on how many guards a vault may generate, only one will appear at a time.\nIf you are visibly present in a vault when the guard appears, they will ask you for your name. If you reply with Croesus, Kroisos or Creosote, they will believe you and disappear; this incurs a small alignment penalty for lying if you are lawful, unless it is also your actual name. Attempting this after killing the actual Croesus will cause them to turn hostile.\nIf you are in a polymorphed state from eating a mimic corpse when a guard appears, they will not notice you and leave, puzzled; doing so while hallucinating produces a different message, but otherwise has the same effect. Polymorphing into a form that can hide under items produces the same message. If you are unable to speak from paralysis, unconsciousness, being in the middle of engraving, or else being in a form that prevents speaking, they will also leave. The guard will not notice you if you are invisible when they enter, and will leave when you move away from them.\nOtherwise, upon giving them a name, they will ask you to drop all of your gold and follow them out of the vault; this includes any gold you have in open inventory \"and\" in containers within your inventory, so stashing cannot fool them. Once they see you have no gold, they will open a passage from the vault to a nearby corridor in the dungeon and wait for you to follow them out; both the guard and passage will vanish once you safely reach the corridor. Items left inside the passage will be embedded in the solid rock; any monsters caught in the disappearing passage will be moved to a random location on the current level. If you attack the guard, attempt to escape by some other means, or take too long to comply, they will become hostile. If a guard dies in the passageway they create, it will close immediately; their corpse and possessions will be left embedded in stone, along with you if you were also in the passage.\nAs fighters, guards are able to move at the same speed as an unhasted hero, with an AC that is usually 0 or less, similar to a sergeant; however, they can deal more damage than even Yendorian captains, who have the same monster difficulty. Their sole weapon attack that can hit for up to 40 base damage (incidentally the same as Croesus's weapon attack); the rub of this is that, as described above, guards are very easy to avoid fighting, and are usually not worth bothering anyway.\nTheir presence can be useful for players who happen upon a vault completely by accident and have no other means of escape; after dropping their gold and following the guard out, they can grab a means of digging (e.g. a mattock) and go back to the vault to retrieve the gold. Once players can reliably make their way in and out of vaults, e.g. via digging or controlled teleports, the guard is little more than a minor obstacle, and a quick lie will get them out of your hair. Some players name their character Croesus (or one of the acceptable variants) to avoid the alignment penalty for lying, although this is only a concern for lawful characters; even for other lawful characters the penalty is small, and in most cases can be easily remedied.\nAs long as you drop all your gold, they will escort you out; if you pick up the gold again, they will demand you drop it and turn hostile if you do not comply quickly. However, you can freely teleport it away or throw it outside of the vault instead without angering them. While guards can be bribed, since they are already peaceful, this will likely turn them hostile, and is often a waste of gold even when successful; that said, it can be used in some corner cases, e.g. to pacify a hostile guard and avoid risking penalties for murder.\nLawful and neutral vault-hunters who have dealt with Croesus and cleared Fort Ludios will want to avoid using Croesus's name or its variants when answering guards, since this will immediately turn the guard hostile; killing a guard counts as murder, even if the guard attacks you first. However, most characters at this point will have a means to quickly enter and leave vaults as they please, and can avoid dealing with guards in the first place, much less turning them hostile.\nChaotic characters are not penalized for murder, and can theoretically farm guards for items, but will still suffer an alignment penalty for killing a monster designated \"always peaceful\". Most of the items a guard will have are generally not worthwhile, since there is usually no shortage of barracks and soldiers in a given game; any character that can defeat a guard is usually more than capable of handling those. As such, guard farming is usually only of interest to extinctionist players, as well as chaotic players who have somehow exhausted any other reliable source of items and can somehow soak up the alignment penalties.\nShould a player dealing with a guard somehow get stuck in a disappearing passageway, they can pray to escape; being stuck in a wall is considered a major trouble, and a successful prayer will teleport them out. If teleportation somehow fails, the player will be granted temporary phasing for a few turns, which should be enough for them to make it back onto a safe square.\nbrbr\n",
    "couatl": "Couatl\nThe couatl, , is the weakest of the angelic beings. It is one of the few non-sea monsters to possess a drowning attack.

The magic missiles they fire at range are similar to those from a wand of magic missile, but can be done at will. Like other monsters with magic missile attacks, angels have magic resistance.\nAngels that are randomly generated almost exclusively appear in the service of one of the deities, and appear in large numbers on the Astral Plane. You can also obtain a guardian angel as a minion when you arrive on the Astral Plane if your alignment is sufficiently high and you are not causing conflict; if you are generating conflict, a group of hostile angels will be generated instead.\nIf you are lawful, randomly generated angels will be generated peaceful. In 3.6.0, of randomly appearing angels will be minions of a random god from your pantheon; usually they will be peaceful to co-aligned players, but some will be made \"renegade\", and peaceful to cross-aligned players instead.\nAngels are generated with a noncursed erodeproof large shield, with a 1/4 chance of the shield becoming a shield of reflection, and a blessed erodeproof long sword, with a 1/20 chance of the sword becoming either Demonbane or Sunsword if each artifact has yet to be generated, The tame guardian angel you get when entering the Astral Plane gets slightly better gear: their weapon is blessed and its enchantment raised by 1-4 points (if it's under +4), and they will be given an amulet of reflection if they do not get a shield of reflection.\nThe wand of death is completely ineffective against angels, and they have a good chance of having a shield of reflection, which neuters other attack wands and spells. They are cold resistant, but still vulnerable to fire, so casting the spell of fireball at Skilled or Expert might do significant damage; however, you may have trouble mustering the necessary power to cast spells repeatedly in most situations involving angels, which will usually occur on the Astral Plane while you are carrying the Amulet of Yendor.\nWhen fighting angels in melee, Firebrand and Stormbringer are among the best weapon choices; however, on the Astral Plane, you will likely be seeking to find your high altar, so a footrice corpse will be preferable in that scenario, as is a wand of teleportation.\nTo avoid generating a group of hostile angels when you arrive on the Astral Plane, wait a few turns after you arrive before generating conflict.\nIn UnNetHack, Angels will attack any demons they see, (and vice versa) as part of Nephi's grudge patch.\nSpliceHack adds angels as a starting race.\n",

Perhaps more importantly, their high hit points, damaging attacks, ability to heal self, and high magic resistance make them powerful enough to survive in Gehennom.\nOnce you have mounted a ki-rin, you should not dismount unless absolutely necessary. Since only Knights start with riding skill at Basic, other roles will not be able to pick up objects, #loot containers, drop items on altars, #dip items in fountains, and so forth initially. Because a ki-rin will go feral after five mount attempts, it is better to advance riding skill on a more traditional mount such as a horse first, then switch to your ki-rin once you reach basic skill. Roles which are restricted in riding will probably not have much use for them.\nA Knight does \"not\" reduce tameness when mounting a steed. Thus, they are free to mount and dismount a ki-rin as many times as they wish without fear of it going feral as a result.\nPrior to NetHack 3.6.0, ki-rin were able to wear amulets, boots, shields, and gloves despite being ridable. This was bug C341-18. Variants based on 3.4.3 that did not address this bug themselves will allow a ki-rin to wear additional equipment, including obtaining reflection from an amulet or shield.\nIn addition to all the benefits above, ki-rin in SLASH'EM require a +3 weapon to hit. This makes them better steeds; they are immune to most physical attacks, including powerful minotaurs and even some demon princes; it also makes them more dangerous should you encounter a hostile one. Ki-rin are not level-drain or stoning resistant, so an amulet of drain resistance or an amulet versus stone is a good option for the amulet slot. Ki-rin are also given as minions to lawful players, starting at level 13, though minions cannot be saddled or ridden.\nThe ki-rin originates from Chinese mythology, and it is considered benevolent. It resembles a horse- or deer-shaped Asian dragon with deer-like horns.\nThe name is more often romanized as \"qilin\".\n",
    "archon": "Archon\nThe Archon, , is a powerful monster that appears in \"NetHack\". Archons are the most powerful of the angelic beings, and have the second highest difficulty level of all randomly generated monsters after the arch-lich. They can attack four times per turn, including an active gaze attack that blinds and stuns you, and can cast spells as well.\nArchons can be normally generated, but have such high difficulty that even for a level 30 player, they cannot appear before dungeon level 22. Since the Dungeons of Doom end around level 29 and Archons cannot be generated in Gehennom, most characters will not see one before finding the Amulet of Yendor. Once you have the Amulet, your effective dungeon level is at least 45, so Archons may be randomly generated from the Castle up. The random A generated on the second version of Medusa's Island can be an Archon, but the odds are quite low.\nArchons will always be peaceful for lawful characters of non-negative alignment.\nIf neither Demonbane nor Sunsword have yet been created, the first Archon to be normally generated will be given one of them; they are also guaranteed a shield of reflection.\nArchons' guaranteeds shield will reflect any kind of spell up to a death ray, but Vorpal Blade can decapitate them. They are too large to be bisected by The Tsurugi of Muramasa. The best way to fight Archons, beyond possessing magic resistance, is to use a footrice corpse and blind yourself to protect against their gaze. Wearing the Eyes of the Overworld also prevents you from being stunned or blinded by this attack. Another option is to try avoiding them and keep moving, and can be aided by exploiting their inability to unlock doors can help. Some players consider peaceful Archons a significant advantage of being lawful.\nExcessive use of genocide may lead to an \"Archonstorm\", a scenario in which overwhelming numbers of Archons begin to appear in the endgame in place of other high-level monsters that have been genocided. Neutral and chaotic players can keep the chances of such a scenario low by using genocide sparingly. Lawful humans will probably want to use moderation in using genocide as well, due to the \u22121 alignment penalty associated with it.\nArchons are are exceedingly popular as pets due to their power; as pets cannot cast attack spells, the arch-lich is far less desirable due to its weak cold attack and complete lack of other physical attacks. The easiest way to get a pet Archon is to apply a blessed figurine of an Archon. It is possible for a high-level character to tame an Archon with a spell, but its high monster magic resistance all but ensures it will require a number of attempts. The Castle is the most promising place to farm for one with the spell once your level is high enough, but Vlad's Tower might also do.\nPacifists in need of a powerful pet may use an early wish for a blessed figurine of an Archon. Though figurine generation ignores starting inventories as of NetHack 3.6.0, an Archon's powerful base stats will be more than enough for it to make use of whatever it is equipped with.\nArchons are capable of wearing gloves, helms, boots, and shields, and will also pick up and use a variety of items. They are permanently fast after they cast haste self, hit hard overall, and will often use their blinding gaze against enemies; monsters cannot be stunned in the same way as the player. Additionally, a level 25 or higher Archon will always ignore conflict from a ring (level 30 for a weapon) due to its high monster magic resistance; a level 32 or higher Archon will also be immune to polymorph traps, but not level teleport traps. \nGetting an Archon to drop their starting weapon can be difficult; applying a bullwhip towards them can strip them of their current weapon, allowing you to hand them another weapon or enchant their initial one before handing it back.\nIn SLASH'EM, because the dungeon is much deeper, there is a higher probability you'll encounter them before the castle. Solars make even better pets.\nTake into account that here you will need a +4 weapon to hit them. If you were planning to use firearms to bypass their reflection, you'll need +4 bullets.\nArchons in dNetHack are split into 7 varieties. The counterpart to the vanilla Archon is a Throne Archon. In addition, as the #loot command can now take items from pets, it's much easier to remove Sunsword or Demonbane from a pet. You can also use this to give them a different artifact or a non-artifact enchanted weapon, and take Sunsword for yourself.\n\"Archon\" is Greek (\u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \"arkhon\") for \"ruler\" or \"lord\". It refers to ancient Greek \"ruling gods\".\n",
    "horned devil": "Horned devil\nThe horned devil, , is a major demon that appears in \"NetHack\". It is considered the weakest of the major demons, with a lower monster difficulty than even the barbed devil despite having a higher AC. It is also ranked as weaker than the water demon, which has weaker attacks and a comparably good AC; this is likely because the water demon is faster, can swim, and may potentially appear much earlier.\nThe horned devil is flagged to only appear in Gehennom, but no lawful creatures can be randomly generated there; thus, they are effectively never randomly generated. This trait also occurs with barbed devils and the erinys.\nHorned devils are generated in graveyards above Gehennom; within Gehennom, they can still appear within devil lairs upon level generation. They are also eligible for gating by other major demons.\nThey are generated with either a trident (75% chance) or a bullwhip (25% chance).\n",
    "erinys": "Erinys\nThe erinys, , is a major demon in NetHack. Only three can ever be generated, and therefore become extinct readily (as all three of them will often appear at once).\nHowever, in SLASH'EM, the card justice can summon an erinys, even if they are extinct.\n",
    "barbed devil": "Barbed devil\nBarbed devils, , are a kind of major demon that appears in \"NetHack\". They have stronger attacks than horned devils, but possess weaker AC.\nBarbed devils are flagged to appear only in Gehennom, but no lawful creatures can be randomly generated there; thus, they are effectively never randomly generated. They share this trait with horned devils and erinyes.\nBarbed devils may be created in groups wherever they do appear, and are valid forms for a polymorph trap, which may result in them appearing much earlier in the main dungeon. They are also eligible for gating by other major demons.\nBarbed devils' damage is unimpressive, and even in groups they are not much threat to a player skilled in dealing with demons or multiple opponents.\n",
    "marilith": "Marilith\nThe marilith, , is a major demon that appears in NetHack. They can deal damage extremely quickly, because they possess six attacks per move; mariliths have two weapon attacks and four 2d4 claw attacks. Mariliths do not wield two weapons; rather, the two attacks are performed with its primary weapon, and followed by the claw attacks.\nLike most demons, the marilith is normally only generated in Gehennom, but is also a valid form for polymorph traps; thus, it may be seen in other branches of the dungeon. Mariliths are also eligible for being gated in by other major demons.\nMariliths are interesting choices as pets or even as a self-polymorph target, especially with their execellent natural AC and a highly enchanted and/or powerful artifact weapon in the primary slot; a pet marilith is intelligent and will not wield a cross-aligned artifact weapon or anything made of silver.\nNote that polymorphing into a marilith will break worn armor; mariliths cannot wear boots, shirts or body armor. Fortunately, on top of their AC, they can also #twoweapon.\nMariliths originate from Dungeons and Dragons. Unlike their NetHack counterparts, D&D mariliths can wield six weapons simultaneously.\n",
    "vrock": "Vrock\nThe vrock, , is a demon in NetHack. They possess five attacks per move, which can be deadly to an unprepared player; however they only appear in Gehennom unless summoned by another demon or as a polymorph trap result, so most players will be ready to deal with them by the time they appear.\nIn dNethack, they can be summoned by attempting to convert a unaligned (aligned to Moloch) altar, such as the ones in the balrog version of Mine's End.\nThey are notorious for being able to summon more vrocks due to its large amount of hit dice, creating rooms full of monsters in mere turns.\n",
    "hezrou": "Hezrou\nThe hezrou, , is a demon in NetHack. They are slow, but can hit fairly hard.\nHezrou are large and incapable of wearing any body armor; however, they can put on helms, boots and gloves.\nHezrou are normally only generated in Gehennom, but are also valid polymorph forms, e.g. from a polymorph trap; this makes it a potential nasty surprise for players.\nLike any major demon outside of the balrog and foocubus, the hezrou can summon other demons when attacking, and is eligible for gating; polymorphing into a hezrou and attacking a monster with bare or gloved hands grants a chance per hit landed to summon other tame demons. (\"Some hell-p has arrived!\")\nHezrou are not particularly threatening by the time they are generated, due to their slow speed and relatively paltry damage; however, a monster polymorphed into a hezrou by a trap fairly early in the dungeon can be a deadly threat. Unlike other demons, however, the hezrou's lack of speed makes it easier for you to avoid, and it shares the usual demonic weaknesses to cold and silver.\nIf you find yourself polymorphed into a hezrou as the result of a trap, destroying your body armor, gating in some pet hezrou can serve as a means of defense until you find replacement armor.\n",
    "bone devil": "Bone devil\nA bone devil, , is a major demon that appears in NetHack. It can attack twice per turn, and the stinging attack that follows its weapon attack can cause strength drain without poison resistance.\nThe bone devil is normally only generated in Gehennom, but is also a valid form for a polymorph trap, which may result in it appearing much earlier. Bone devils are also eligible for gating by other major demons.\nBone devils are not particularly threatening to an average player that has reached Gehennom; as the result of a monster stepping on a polymorph trap, its naturally low AC can make it a potential nasty surprise for players unless the player is sufficiently prepared and has poison resistance. Like most demons, it is vulnerable to silver and cold attacks.\nBecause of its below-average MR, polymorphing your pet into a bone devil via trap makes it somewhat difficult to change the pet's form afterward.\n",
    "ice devil": "Ice devil\nThe ice devil, , is a demon in NetHack. It has a 25% chance of being generated with a spear, but never gets random offensive items. While slow (it gets one move to your two), it can pack a punch, especially if you lack cold resistance. It makes a decent pet in the early game which can take out e.g. the Minetown Priest, but isn't upper-tier due to the speed.\n",
    "nalfeshnee": "Nalfeshnee\nThe nalfeshnee, , is a demon in NetHack. They are one of the few ordinary demons capable of spell-casting and can be considered dangerous in this respect, as a sufficiently high-level one can summon nasties. They are also a very frequent source of annoying item curses.\n",
    "pit fiend": "Pit fiend\nThe pit fiend, , is a demon that appears in \"NetHack\". Like most demons, it is normally only generated in Gehennom, but is also a valid form for polymorphing, usually from polymorph traps; thus, it may be seen in other branches of the dungeon. Pit fiends are also eligible for gating by other major demons.\nPit fiends generate YAFM when falling into pits, which they share with pit vipers.\nThe pit fiend has a naturally low AC and three attacks per turn; the third hit is a grabbing attack, which can be especially perilous if you encounter them far earlier in the game than normal due to monsters polymorphing. Elbereth can be useful to drive them off, and you can also teleport yourself, allowing you to escape or else prepare a means of fighting back (e.g. with a wand of cold or silver weapon).\nIn Gehennom where they normally occur, they are not as much of a threat, as most players at this point will have a silver weapon or two and/or a few methods to deal cold damage, on top of higher AC themselves and a much more reliable hit-rate.\n",
    "balrog": "Balrog\nThe balrog, , is the most physically imposing of the non-unique major demons in \"NetHack\". Unlike most other major demons, balrogs are incapable of summoning other demons; they share this property with foocubi. \nBalrogs are normally only generated in Gehennom, but are also a valid form for a polymorph trap. They are eligible for being summoned via gating by other major demons and their more powerful kin.\nAll balrogs are armed with a whip and broadsword.\nBalrogs have a solid base AC and high monster magic resistance, along with flight and resistances to fire and poison. Though easily among the more intimidating threats, they have no spellcasting or gating ability and are very slow by the standards of Gehennom monsters; players are likely to have good AC themselves by this point, along with any combination of at least one silver weapon, a source of cold damage, and at least fast speed.\nA balrog can technically steal your weapon with its bullwhip; however, due to the way monsters prioritize weapons, it will only wield the bullwhip if it somehow loses its broadsword.\nBalrogs are among the best choices for a pet that are obtainable from a polymorph trap. In addition to the above qualities, balrogs are also inediate and strong, and a properly equipped balrog is a handy shop-raiding pet that can steamroll through shopkeepers. However, their high monster MR means they will often resist a wand of speed monster, making it difficult to counteract their low speed, and they cannot wear torso armor or helmets. \nArchons are generally better and easier to manage, but can usually only be obtained as a pet by wishing for a blessed figurine of one; balrogs are somewhat more 'available' in comparison, but still difficult to obtain, and the player will need to actively keep their health up.\nAs indicated by the encyclopedia entry, the balrog and its signature weapons originate from the .\n",
    "geryon": "Geryon\nGeryon, , is one of the demon princes. He is one of three not to have his own lair (the other two being Dispater and Demogorgon), and therefore is not guaranteed to appear; he will only arrive via demon summoning or a monster casting summon nasties in Gehennom.\nHe will start out peaceful (unless you have Excalibur), and ask for payment.\nDue to his low speed, most players should be able to kill him without taking damage.\nGeryon is derived from a Dungeons and Dragons demon, which is in turn derived from an ancient Greek monster.\nThe ancient Greek sources about his appearance are inconsistent with regards to numbers of heads, bodies, and limbs. The D&D version has a snake-like body, hairy human hands, a human head, bat wings and a poisoned tail-tip.\n",
    "sandestin": "Sandestin\nThe sandestin, , is the rarest of the shapeshifting monsters in NetHack, and is only generated in Gehennom. Although it is represented by the glyph of a major demon, it is not one. Sandestins have a 1/6 chance of changing form per turn, and will mimic monsters that may be created by summon nasties 6/7 of the time, or a random monster the rest of the time. It is quite possible to play NetHack for a long time without knowing the existence of these monsters, as they always mimic other monsters and leave no corpse. They will often be peaceful to chaotics, which is an easy way to tell them from the monsters they mimic, most of which are always generated hostile, and chameleons, which are neutral. As well of course, donning a ring of protection from shape changers will show them for what they are.\n",
    "doppelganger": "Doppelganger\nThe doppelganger is a shapeshifter. They will imitate player monsters and occasionally monsters that may be created by summon nasties. Each turn they have a one-sixth chance of attempting to change form; one-seventh of these attempts will turn them into a nasty and two-thirds of the rest will change them into a random player monster.\nDoppelgangers that are imitating player monsters will take the rank titles for that role, based upon its level - a doppelganger imitating a fourth-tier Healer appears as a \"Dresser\", one imitating an equivalent Wizard appears as a \"Magician\".\nDoppelgangers are considered human for sacrifice and cannibalism purposes. Eating a doppelganger corpse will cause you to polymorph, unless you have unchanging. This will polymorph pets as well, which is one of the dangers of leaving carnivorous pets (especially purple worms) near doppelgangers.\nIn SLASH'EM, doppelgangers are a playable race, with high stats, natural protection, and, as one might expect, the ability to polymorph at will, via the \"#youpoly\" extended command. However, doing that will cost power. A very useful tactic is to polymorph into something when going near a hard battle, to have both the benefits of the new form, and those of reforming as a doppelganger when you should die.\nAn excellent choice of Role for a doppelganger is a monk, since these would benefit from the polymorph much more than anything else.\n",

Like all quest nemeses, he is covetous, and can inflict very large amounts of damage due to his two weapon attacks and spellcasting (which includes drain strength and destroy armor). It's recommended that you awaken him remotely (or else teleport to the upstair after doing so) and engage him there with a means of engraving Elbereth and a source of magic resistance; in 3.6.0 and later versions, consider using a scroll of scare monster for this strategy as well.\nAs a demon, he is immune to a wand of death, and his high monster magic resistance lets him easily resist a wand of sleep or polymorph; he also shares the usual major demon resistances to fire, poison and level draining, as well as the quest nemesis immunity to stoning. Wielding a blessed silver saber is very effective, as is a dwarvish mattock - the Minion is a large monster, and the archaeologist can achieve Expert in both the pick-axe and saber skills. However, remember that he can cast the curse items spell; even with magic resistance, a cursed mattock will leave you without the use of your hands, so prepare a means of emergency curse removal if you employ this strategy, such as a bag with scrolls of remove curse or a cache of holy water.\n",

He can curse your items, destroy your armor, and even summon nasties, making facing him head-on in melee a bad idea, especially without magic resistance. Like all , Thoth Amon does not respect Elbereth. \nHowever, he can be immobilized or taken out from a distance through various means. A wand of cancellation can reliably prevent him from casting spells, as he has very low MR; without them, his weaker melee attacks are easily manageable for a level 14 barbarian. A wand of sleep can render him entirely helpless against the barbarian's powerful melee attacks, and a wand of death can kill him outright.\n",

If you can engage him on the stairs with one on the floor, you can easily beat him to death.\nFortunately, the Cyclops is susceptible to most magical attacks due to his MR of 0. Sleep is guaranteed to work on him, although the ray may miss due to his AC of 0. A wielded potion of sleeping is more likely to hit, and a wielded potion of polymorph is highly likely to cripple him, along with the wand of polymorph, which will never miss.

As with all covetous monsters, it may be more ideal to engrave Elbereth or drop a scroll of scare monster on the stairs and awaken him from there.\nIn practice, Ixoth will not use his fire breath unless he has teleported to the upstair to heal, since his covetous behavior will put him in melee range. His magic resistance from the Magic Mirror of Merlin will prevent wands of polymorph or wands of death from working on him, but not the wand of sleep.

If you are prepared with decent armor (around AC \u221215) and a good weapon, you should engage him, then go stand on the up staircase. Elbereth or a scroll of scare monster may also come in handy.\n",
    "scorpius": "Scorpius\nHis fighting strategy involves teleporting near you, using his sting attack to inflict sickness and dealing some damage along the way. After that, he will usually leave you one turn for you to attack him, and then teleport away. The damage he deals is moderate, but manageable - after teleporting away, he will usually leave you alone for long enough for you to recover from the damage. The main problem is his sting attack that may cause illness, and will kill you if you can't heal from it.\nHe is generally considered one of the easier quest nemeses to defeat.\nIt's a good idea to have a way to cure yourself from illness, either via healing potions, spells, or preferably, a unicorn horn. Alternatively, spend some time kicking trees in the upper filler level - each tree will give a bunch of fruits exactly once, and you might find some eucalyptus leaves.\nOne way to defeat Scorpius is to play defensively, by dropping a scroll of scare monster and waiting for him to come after you, and then attack him when he teleports near you. As he lacks any sort of ranged or spellcasting attack, this renders him completely harmless. His pitiful AC then makes it very easy to finish him off.\nAnother way to defeat Scorpius is to use range. Get far enough from the upstair so that you can just hit the upstair with your bow and your original +2 arrows. Wake and wound Scorpius remotely, by arrow, wand, thrown dagger, dart or other means. He will then teleport to the upstair. As long as you stay far enough away, Scorpius will not flee upstairs, and continued fire should easily defeat him.\n",
    "master assassin": "Master Assassin\nThe \nReaching him generally proves to be more difficult than fighting him, due to the design of the level. While the Master Assassin can be very annoying, if you're a competent fighter, he doesn't pose much of a threat to you. However, he has a nasty habit of teleporting into the lower left corner of his level (the area that is inaccessible to you while in the larger middle portion) and healing himself. There are a few good ways to take him out quickly and easily:\nBULLET::::- Zap him with a wand of death, if you have one, to get rid of him instantly.\nBULLET::::- Throw a potion of sickness at him and he'll soon be gone.\nBULLET::::- Throw a potion of at him, then beat his head in. You may wish to wield the potion if you want to be sure it will hit. Zapping him with a wand of sleep can also achieve the same ends.\nAlternatively, after he lands on the upstairs, leave the level via whatever means you have prepared and re-enter. This will remove the whole \"hard to reach\" part of the conflict and reduce it to a basic boss fight.\nInstead of reaching him directly, you can also use a drum of earthquake, a cursed potion of invisibility, the shriek of a shrieker, or the psychic blast of a mind flayer to wake him up while you're standing on the upstair. This will cause him to warp to you and attack, while preventing him from escaping to the floor above.\n",
    "ashikaga takauji": "Ashikaga Takauji\nDue to the flavor text produced from his defeat (as seen on the Samurai quest article), he will never leave a corpse.\nLike all humans, Ashikaga Takauji ignores Elbereth; while his attacks are normally unimpressive, he has two weapon attacks and will wield your quest artifact against you, possibly causing instadeath by bisection. This and his base AC of 0 makes him one of the most dangerous quest nemeses to face in melee range, and there is no shame in considering leaving Takauji alone unless you have options to actually deal with him; more cautious players may wait until they have a more thoroughly assembled kit with a fallback measure, usually an amulet of life saving. The samurai player monsters on the quest often carry attack wands that may be useful in dispatching him, however.\nIt is very easy to approach Ashikaga Takauji without disturbing him from his meditation, due to the layout of the level; the final entrance before the inner section gives you a clear shot with any ranged weapon or wand, while still being far enough that he will not wake up. He has no elemental immunities or extrinsic magic resistance, so the wand of death can put an end to him immediately, and any attack wand that hits can do enough damage for him to immediately flee to the up staircase, ignoring the Tsurugi. You can use this opportunity to pick up and stash the Tsurugi before he can return, making him relatively trivial to defeat; you can also leave a powerful pet near the upstairs to finish him off as he tries to heal.\nA wand of sleep may also work, but carries the risk that his magic resistance will allow him to resist the ray, possibly waking him up and giving him a chance swing the Tsurugi at you. If you take this route, it is strongly recommended to wear an amulet of life saving before engaging, to reduce the risk of YASD to an unlucky Tsurugi hit.\nAn alternative strategy is to polymorph into any monster of large size or bigger to avoid the risk of being bisected; polymorphing into a black dragon adds the ability to kill Ashikaga Takauji instantly with disintegration breath via the #monster command, and neither the Tsurugi nor the Bell of Opening will be harmed.\nIf needed, the disarm technique can get Ashikaga to drop the Tsurugi with fairly decent frequency, just in case a melee fight is unavoidable. One can then hit him, to make him teleport to the stairs and heal, leaving the Tsurugi behind. \nAshikaga Takauji was a historical figure of medieval Japan. He was Shogun from 1338 to 1358.\n",
    "lord surtur": "Lord Surtur\nLike any other fire giant, eating Lord Surtur's corpse may grant fire resistance, with a 50% chance (compare to 30% from any other fire giant), and also has a chance to raise the player's strength. \nLord Surtur can be defeated easily by a prepared Valkyrie. Even so, he is likely one of the first covetous enemies a Valkyrie will meet, and novice players must still handle him carefully.\nSince Surtur is generated meditating at the center of his lair, any Valkyrie can easily clear the area of his fellow fire giants and fire ants. Like all other quest nemesis, you can also awaken him remotely and bring him to you; Lord Surtur respects Elbereth and the scroll of scare monster, which can be used to your advantage in either scenario.\nLord Surtur can be killed instantly with a wand of death. A wand of polymorph or wand of sleep may also work, but may take a few attempts due to his relatively high MR.\nAs a monster that is fire resistant but not cold resistant, he will take extra damage from cold attacks, such as a wand of cold.\nLord Surtur's depiction draws directly from Norse mythology; in \"The Prose Edda\", Surtr is depicted as an important giant of Ragnar\u00f6k, the Norse mythos's end of the world. The mythological name is spelled Surtr in Old Norse, and Surtur in modern-day Icelandic.\n",
    "lord carnarvon": "Lord Carnarvon\nIn dNetHack, Lord Carnarvon is always generated with a blessed +7 pistol and 26-31 blessed +7 bullets. This is probably the only firearm most Archeologists will ever see (unless playing in a bones-rich environment); even so, it's not worth \"liberating\" from him, as the bullet supply is barely enough to train the skill to Basic, and there's no way bar wishing to obtain more.\n",

    "grand master": "Grand Master\nThe Like his abbots, he is capable of clerical spell-casting, and his melee attacks are more powerful than other quest leaders, reflecting the monk's affinity towards martial arts. Interestingly, he has fire resistance, shock resistance, sleep resistance and poison resistance, much like a highly experienced player monk would. \nUnlike other quest leaders, and like abbots and player monster monks, he is generated\u00a0without a weapon.\nThe Grand Master shares his encyclopedia entry with the monk.\n",

The most important thing to note is that he will pick up the Platinum Yendorian Express Card as soon as the player disturbs him, and will therefore have magic resistance\u2014so death rays and so forth will not hurt him. This is scarcely a problem, as he is relatively unimpressive in melee and lacks special attacks beyond being able to steal the PYEC back from you if you get it before killing him. He also lacks any other resistances; if you have any poisoned darts on hand, e.g. your starting stack of +2 darts, a flurry of them will drop him quickly and possibly even instakill him, especially if you have sufficient skill in darts,\n",

    "neferet the green": "Neferet the Green\nNeferet the Green replaced the Wizard of Balance as Wizard Quest Leader in NetHack 3.4.0, perhaps because Wizards, who were always neutral up to and including NetHack 3.2.3, can now be neutral or chaotic. Your quest leader's alignment is adjusted to match your starting alignment, and it doesn't make sense for a Wizard of Balance to be chaotic.\nNeferet the Green may be a reference to Nefertiti, an Egyptian queen of the 18th dynasty, or to Nofret (also sometimes called Neferet or Nefert), an Egyptian princess from the 4th dynasty; 'Nfr-t' is a transliteration of the hieroglyphs meaning \"beautiful woman\". Given that the Wizard role uses a Pantheon of Egyptian gods, a reference to Ancient Egypt seems likely.\n",
    "woodchuck": "Woodchuck\nThe woodchuck is an extremely rare creature. Otherwise, it serves no special purpose, apart from being a pain to extinctionists. It can swim.\nThe woodchuck's stats appear almost identical to those of the rock mole, which precedes it in the . The only differences, besides the generation frequency and the glyph color, are its diet, ability to swim and tendency to wander. Note that both the woodchuck and the rock mole are tunnelers and as such can chop down trees and tunnel through rock walls.\nIt is not normally generated, and usually must be explicitly created by means of a figurine, stone to fleshing a statue, reverse genocide, or polymorph.\nThe only way you may ever see a woodchuck in your game without intentionally generating one (e.g. using reverse genocide) is if a monster is polymorphed. Additionally, a chameleon or other shapeshifting creature may assume the form of a woodchuck.\nIts inclusion is a joke, to do with the Oracle and \"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?\". The joke is a reference to the real life Usenet Oracle. The internet has the entire text of Oracularity 576-06.\nIn some variants, including UnNetHack and xNetHack, woodchucks attack the Oracle on sight as part of the grudge patch. In UnNetHack, one woodchuck will always appear on the Oracle level, and can very rarely appear over time.\nIn SLASH'EM, woodchucks are marginally more common, as there's often a single woodchuck generated in the Oracle level. On Groundhog Day (February 2), many woodchucks spawn on the Oracle level, with a recurring message of \"No more woodchucks!\"\n",
    "gray ooze": "Gray ooze\nThe gray ooze, , is a weak amoeboid NetHack monster. It is extremely slow, but its bite causes rusting and can damage iron armor if it manages to land an attack. \nAs an acidic monster, the gray ooze is capable of dissolving a spider web. Unlike brown and black puddings, it will not divide when you hit it without killing it.\nLike all puddings, gray oozes leave a glob instead of a corpse. This can be eaten like a corpse, and may become tainted, but never fully rots away. The glob is acidic and has a chance of conveying fire, cold, or poison resistance.\nBy the time you encounter a gray ooze, you should be more than capable of defeating it easily, unless you are a Tourist. Its rusting attack and ability to pass under doors makes this monster more annoying than dangerous. \nIt's best to take gray oozes out with ranged attacks as they are very slow, if not persistent. If you lack the means to kill it from afar and don't want to expend a wand's charge on it, let your pet deal with it. If all else fails, you could punch it to death after unequipping all iron equipment. Only do this if it is safe to do so, i.e. there aren't any other monsters nearby.\nIn NetHack 3.4.3 and earlier, gray oozes left a corpse instead of a glob when killed.\nIn NetHack 3.6.0, globs could not give resistances when eaten.

Additionally in UnNetHack, a player killed by a Nazgul will arise as a barrow wight if a bones file is created.\nSporkHack, EvilHack, SpliceHack, and UnNetHack implement a screaming attack for Nazgul. The range is limited, but causes its target to be stunned. Additionally, in EvilHack this attack has a chance to shatter any glass objects in open inventory that have not been fixed.\nIn EvilHack and SpliceHack, Nazgul ride steeds known as fell beasts, which are dangerous creatures in their own right.\n",

    "tiger": "Tiger\nThe tiger, , is a monster in \"NetHack\". It is the most powerful of the felines, but unlike most of its brethren, it is only as fast as the player character is at normal speed.\nDue to lacking the higher speed of other big cats, tigers can be avoided slightly more easily.\nIn dNethack, the tiger is red rather than yellow (), but is otherwise unchanged.\n",

    "winged gargoyle": "Winged gargoyle\nThe winged gargoyle, , is a monster in \"NetHack\".\nWinged gargoyles hit even harder than the basic gargoyle and are known to appear deceptively simple to deal with, but causing many deaths. They are relatively fast (at speed 15 compared to a native 12 for a player) and hit for between 9 and 48 points of damage if all attacks land. As a result, having boosted speed and a low AC are advisable to deal with them. Winged gargoyles are only encountered at relatively deep dungeon levels, so most players are able to deal with them when encountered.\nBeing made of stone, winged gargoyles resist stoning, so save your rubber chicken and cockatrice eggs for other opponents. They are not, however, negatively affected by wands of digging, nor are their corpses unsuitable to eat (although they convey no intrinsics).\nThe monster class contains only gremlins, gargoyles, and winged gargoyles, making it a poor candidate for a blessed scroll of genocide.\nA player polymorphed into a female winged gargoyle can lay eggs, but most will be ordinary gargoyle eggs; very few will be winged gargoyle eggs.\nIf you can tame them, winged gargoyles make excellent pets, and are relatively common at deeper dungeon levels.\n",

Cave spider corpses have a 7% chance of gaining the poison resistance intrinsic.\nCave spiders can gain experience and grow up into giant spiders.\nCave spiders are often generated in groups; cave spiders generated upon the creation dungeon level always get a random item to hide under.\nWhile not particularly dangerous for the first hiding monsters you are likely to encounter, cave spiders have a somewhat low AC that can make it slightly difficult to hit them. Throwing an item at them will cause them to hide under it most of the time, useful for keeping them at bay and picking them off, or even escaping if the situation warrants it. This can also be put to use in some treasure zoos, where a hiding cave spider can block the door and hem in the other monsters; you can then attack them from range at your leisure, e.g. with a polearm or lance.\n",

Elf-lords can grow up into Elvenkings.\nOutside of normal generation, Elvenkings can be found in throne rooms occupying the throne itself, and are more likely to be found in much deeper throne rooms within the dungeon; Elvenkings are also eligible for the summon nasties monster spell. In addition, there is a guaranteed Elvenking with a 66% chance of carrying pick-axe on the Plane of Earth.\nWhen dealing with the Wizard of Yendor, if he summons nasties, far look any that appear to ensure you are targeting Rodney himself and not an Elvenking; as it is common practice to zap the Wizard with a death ray at the first opportunity, it especially helps to make sure you don't squander a valuable charge on the wrong target.\nThe pick-axe from the Elvenking on the Plane of Earth can be used to navigate through the plane, but only consider this if there are little to no other options available; most players should have their own pick-axe or mattock along with several wands of digging handy by the time they reach the Elemental Planes, and the minotaur that also appears will provide another wand.\nIn GruntHack, Elvenkings are replaced by the racial king and queen monsters.\n",

These monsters are particularly dangerous because they appear in the dungeons early enough that the player might not have cold resistance, and appear in packs. Winter wolf cubs have a long range frost attack which can shatter potions and inflict significant damage on the player.

    "black light": "Black light\nA black light is always generated invisible, but illuminates its surroundings in a 3x3 area centered on itself. Black lights attack by exploding (destroying themselves in the process), causing 10d12 turns of hallucination if the target is the hero, and confusion if the target is a monster . Unlike a gas spore explosion, the explosion of a light only affects the square targeted.\nBlack lights may attack pets if angered by them, or if the hero is displaced and the pet is at the hero's perceived location, so it may be advisable to keep strong pets away from black lights, if possible. Monsters don't have a confusion timer; instead, they have a 2% chance of recovering on each of their moves.\nThe explosion of a black light will wake nearby sleeping monsters.\nIt is possible to create a black light by reading a cursed scroll of light while confused, with a 20% chance of creation. The black light will be invisible as usual. \nThe best course of action is to put on a blindfold or towel and wait for it to explode, or to have a potion of full healing or a unicorn horn handy. In a large unlit area, such as is common in the Gnomish Mines, the presence of a black light can be detected as a moving but invisible source of illumination.

They have immunities to cold, sleep, poison, and stoning.\nSkeletons are only randomly generated in Orcus Town, and they are valid targets for polymorph traps and the summon nasties spell. Polypiling multiple objects made of bone, such as unicorn horns, may also create a skeleton.\nEach skeleton has a chance of getting a leather armor (25%), a knife (8%) or a short sword (16%), but no random offensive item.\nWhile skeletons are not a great threat at the point they are encountered, especially given the presence of shades, their ability to nullify speed still means they should not be overlooked.

Pets, especially ones with multiple attacks, should be kept out of range.\nUnlike the similar blue jelly, it does not split or provide any helpful intrinsics.\n",

They also appear in large numbers on the Plane of Fire.\nThey are generated with a spear ( chance), a trident ( chance), or a stiletto ( chance).\nOne cure for sliming is polymorphing into a fiery monster. Among the fiery monsters, salamanders are the only one that has limbs, and one of the few that have eyes.\nA salamander in \"NetHack\" is very different from a ; it has the torso of a man atop the body of a great snake. This appearance is based on the monsters from \"Dungeons & Dragons\".\nIn UnNetHack, a salamander is one of One-Eyed Sam's pets in the black market.\nIn EvilHack, salamanders can move through lava and can now attempt to drown players in the lava, similar to pythons and eels in water; this is significantly more dangerous, as a successful attack will usually destroy most if not all of the player's inventory outright, along with possibly killing the player themselves.\n",

Unlike other jellies, however, they are the only non-sessile member of the monster class, and can engulf players to cover them with acidic slime; the engulfing attack does not corrode objects, despite being acidic.\nOchre jellies are the second quest monster encountered on the Knight quest, and have a 14% chance to be generated; several ochre jellies are guaranteed to appear in the floors beyond the home level.\nOchre jellies are eligible to be created by the summon nasties monster spell.\nOchre jellies are quite slow, so you can easily run away if you aren't prepared to handle them. Their passive acid attack does a fixed 3d6 damage roll, as opposed to the (XL + 1)d6 of spotted and blue jellies, making their passive much less dangerous in comparison. Like most solid engulfing monsters, a wand of digging or spell of dig will immediately free you and reduce their HP to 1.\nPlayers keeping mind flayer pets will want to keep them away from ochre jellies, whose acidic passive will trigger with each tentacle attack; it may be worth giving them yellow dragon scales/scale mail or a spare alchemy smock for acid resistance.\nIn SLASH'EM, the engulfing attack can now corrode objects in open inventory, including your alignment key.\n",

Centaurs can wield weapons and use magic items, but unlike many other intelligent monsters, centaurs can also move fast and they can kick you.\nForest centaurs are generated with a bow and 3-14 arrows, the other varieties get a crossbow and 3-14 bolts.\nSome centaurs may start peaceful.\nCentaurs are dangerous in melee; their rapid and repeated use of wielded weapons (or bare-handed combat) combined with kicking can quickly harm or kill your character. A centaur with ranged weapons may shoot you. Shoot back or send your pet.\nCentaurs can use:\nBULLET::::- Weapons\nBULLET::::- Shields\nBULLET::::- Helmets\nBULLET::::- Gloves\nBULLET::::- Amulet of life saving\nBULLET::::- Unicorn horn\nBULLET::::- Potion of gain level\nCentaurs make superb steeds; while not quite as fast as a unicorn or a warhorse, a centaur is still very fast - a mountain centaur has a base speed of 20 and when zapped with a wand of speed monster is even faster than a player in speed boots. And unlike a unicorn or warhorse, a well-equipped centaur can take quite a beating, even in Gehennom. They can return quite a beating too: a centaur is the only steed that can wield a weapon, and given a powerful weapon (perhaps a throwaway artifact weapon from sacrificing) can easily match the damage dealt by a dragon or a jabberwock.\nCentaurs are very easy to keep fed, which is of particular importance where steeds are concerned. Every time you attempt to ride a steed, its tameness is decreased by one (except for knights). While ki-rin are sometimes regarded as the \"best\" steeds, they do not eat, and thus they are notoriously difficult for non-knights to keep tame. Just take care if you kill a shapeshifter: unless you dismount first and dispose of the corpse, your centaur is very likely to get to the corpse first if you ride over it. \nCentaurs cannot fly, so as with all land-based steeds, take care around water, and ice too for that matter - it is very easy to slip off the steed on water you've frozen and then displace your steed into the unfrozen water, drowning it. Polymorph traps are not a problem for the centaur if the player has magic resistance: this will protect the steed too while you are riding it. The player's reflection will not transfer to the steed, but a centaur can wear a shield of reflection.\nIn SLASH'EM, a character with an amulet of flying will cause his steed to fly as well, which makes a mountain centaur a viable competitor to the ki-rin for steed of choice; both can wear amulets of reflection, and a centaur can use an artifact weapon and shield, giving it strong damage without the likelihood of going feral. Due to the nature of SLASH'EM's late game, however, be sure to keep a wand of undead turning handy as you will probably have to revive your pet centaur frequently. For this reason, they make better mounts for spellcasters with charm monster rather than for those relying on a scroll of taming or magic harp to re-tame.\nEvilHack adds centaurs as a playable race. Player and monster centaurs can wear all armor, except boots.\n",

From long range, the barrow wight may throw projectiles (usually its knife) and close in to use spells on the player. If the player attempts to engage in melee combat, they put themselves at risk of being stunned, as well as the wight's level draining (but otherwise harmless) weapon attacks. A barrow wight is best dealt with quickly, but without undue alarm.\nThe barrow wight's long sword may be of interest to lawful characters looking for a long sword to create Excalibur.\nBarrow wights originate from the universe of Tolkien's works. \"Barrow\" refers to the burial mounts they normally inhabit, while \"wight\" is old English for \"thing, living being creature\", used in the less archaic sense meaning \"ghost\". It resembles a wraith.\nIn UnNetHack barrow wights are slightly more common; if a player is killed by a Nazgul, they will rise as a barrow wight in the bones file.\nBarrow wights leave corpses (1200l) in Slash'EM Extended, and they are usually hazardous to eat.\n",

An illiterate player who is throne farming might consider polymorphing into a ghoul, wearing an amulet of unchanging, and using a cursed unicorn horn as a source of confusion. Doing so obviously breaks polyselfless conduct, however.\nThere was a bug where one could repeatedly generate ghouls by engraving on the same headstone over and over again (with no limit). This bug was fixed in NetHack 3.4.0.\nGhouls are part of the folklore of undead creatures. It originates from the Arabic \"ghul\", an evil spirit. \nThe depiction and properties can vary. They may be portrayed as more sophisticated zombies or as a type of humanoid monster that eats humans.\nIn SLASH'EM, ghouls have been made slightly more dangerous, paralyzing for 1d6 turns and doing 1d4 damage, as well as having a base level of 5.
