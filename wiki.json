Beware\u2014as in Greek mythology, her gaze can turn people to stone. Additionally, eating the corpse of Medusa is a similarly bad idea that will also turn you to stone.\nAny corpses of unique monsters (including Medusa) can be left in bones files, allowing you to use undead turning to get multiple unique monsters.\nSometimes Medusa can escape to the upstairs, and/or up to the previous level. She can also escape downstairs. So if you lost track of her (i.e. entered blind and then she disappeared from the telepathy map but you don't see a corpse), beware of her around her lair and on the levels immediately above and below.\n",
    "killer bee": "The killer bee, , is a monster that appears in NetHack. They are capable of flight and can outrun an unburdened character with fast speed. While not especially strong individually, they are quite fast and their sting is poisoned, which can drain strength and even instantly kill you if you are not resistant. Their corpses are poisonous and may also drain strength on top of damaging you, but have a 30% chance of granting poison resistance.\nAs killer bee corpses are poisonous and also confer intrinsic poison resistance, extrinsic resistance will also prevent strength loss and significantly reduce damage from the poison until you finally obtain the intrinsic, which should not take too long. You can also nullify the strength penalty through the use of a ring of sustain ability, or reverse it with a unicorn horn; you may also want a tinning kit, which removes the poison and slightly increases the nutrition provided per corpse.\n",

An AC of about \u221210 with a solid weapon and fireproofed pieces of armor is considered safe, and dragon scale mail should be pursued if a wish for one has yet to be obtained.

    "rogue": "Orcish monsters are more likely to be generated peaceful for orcish heroes, while elven monsters (which can be a nuisance because they appear fairly early, in groups, and ignore Elbereth) are likely to be generated peaceful for chaotic humans, but will always be hostile to orcs. Human monsters are not available as early for same-race sacrifices, and some of their corpses are harder to procure reliably compared to the groups of hostile orcs that may be generated.\nThe two top priorities in the early game are finding food and developing your primary attacks, which are weighted differently for humans and orcs. Orcish rogues' starting food items buy them some time to train before they need to start looking for food; once they do need to scavenge for food, they have more options thanks to their poison resistance\u2014which allows them to eat the corpses of poisonous monsters like kobolds safely\u2014and their ability to eat their own kind without an alignment penalty. Human rogues, however, will need to look for nonpoisonous corpses and (better yet) permafood on the first few levels of the dungeons.\nA rogue's best attack in the early game is a volley of thrown daggers. Rogues should rely on throwing daggers as much as circumstances and their stock of daggers permit, to raise the dagger skill to Expert before anything else. Having Expert level in the skill, combined with the role's bonus to multishot, allows you to throw up to four daggers at once, and gives each dagger a +2 damage bonus. However, be aware that if one of your daggers kills your target, any remaining daggers you threw may fly past the corpse and anger peaceful monsters behind it.

    "barbarian": "While barbarians overall should have no trouble dishing out damage, players should be wary not to lean too much on their health and armor to carry them through every fight. The intrinsic poison resistance that barbarians start with widens the list of edible corpses that can be eaten in lieu of permafood. Orcish barbarians find the poison resistance redundant, but will appreciate the additional lack of penalties for cannibalism, and infravision for the Gnomish Mines. For chaotics, orcish barbarians will also have an easier time converting early altars than their human counterparts due to the earlier presence of same-race monsters; human barbarians can still make use of werecreature corpses, but will have to contend with them calling for help and potentially catching lycanthropy from bites.\nThe barbarian quest is not especially difficult, though there are some significant wrinkles. While the monster generation is biased towards ogres, it may also contain a very large number of trolls, which can be the biggest hazard for an underleveled or under-prepared barbarian. If enough trolls are present, they can form an almost perpetual swarm around the player as they rise from the dead faster than they can be permanently disposed of. A tinning kit can be extremely helpful in this situation, as can a wielded footrice corpse; a corpse-eating pet is another option. As a last resort, you can lure one or two trolls at a time from Thoth Amon's lair to the previous level and dispatch them there. This gets the trolls off your back and eventually leaves you free to kill all the ogres and Thoth Amon.\n",

For that reason, do \"not\" eat carrots and apples except in an emergency; for example, being blinded in a dangerous situation, which can be remedied by eating a carrot. Lack of people food is usually not an emergency. Find other sources of food or wait until you become weak and then pray. Carrots and apples can be used to reward a horse who has stolen an item from a shop, encouraging it to steal more items, with no alignment record penalty.\nThe other primary source of food for horses is corpses from creatures like lichens and molds (except yellow molds).\nBULLET::::- They are carnivorous and thus easier to keep fed.

They are poisonous to eat, however, and doing so will toggle intrinsic speed - granting it if you do not have it, and removing it if you already possess it.\nThere is a 5% chance that a quantum mechanic carries a large box. Upon opening the box, with a 50% chance a peaceful housecat named \"Schroedinger's Cat\" is generated; if generation or 50% chance fails, the box will contain a cat corpse named \"Schroedinger's Cat\". The state of the cat is not determined until the box is opened; in fact, the large box is effectively empty until opened. The housecat has no special properties, and is simply based on a well-known thought experiment in quantum physics. See the article for more specific information.\nEating a quantum mechanic corpse is a useful way to gain the speed intrinsic, but should be avoided while you have it; you can tin them to reapply the intrinsic speed if it is lost, e.g. from the attacks of a cockatrice, green slime, or shade. While the same can be done with a wand of speed monster, this allows you to save more of its charges for pets, especially after Orcus-town; use a stethoscope to keep track of your own speed.\n",

They are often found in graveyards, and are known for the fact that eating a fresh wraith corpse causes the player character to gain an experience level. However, wraiths may also drain levels from them.\nThe level gained from eating a wraith's corpse makes them a popular choice for reverse genocide, and the corpses provide zero nutrition, reducing the risk of overeating. However, an oversatiated character can still choke on them. There is a chance the corpse will \"rot away completely\" and provide no experience - dipping it in holy water has no effect on this probability. It isn't possible to tin wraith corpses, but they can be kept fresh in an ice box.\nLike all undead, wraiths killed on a level with a graveyard (or the Castle, which counts as a graveyard level for this purpose) are much less likely to leave a corpse, with 1/9 of the normal 50% chance if killed by the player, or 1/3 of the normal chance if killed by anything else. To get around this, a player may lure the wraith up or down a stairway before dispatching it, or branch-/level teleport while the wraith is adjacent. Alternatively, graveyard wraiths can be saved for a pet purple worm; their engulfing attack is not subject to corpse-leaving odds.

This was once a core component of pudding farming; as of NetHack 3.6.0, black puddings leave globs instead of corpses when they are killed. Globs cannot be sacrificed, revived or tinned, making pudding farming a far less useful tactic.\nIn earlier versions, killing black puddings left normal corpses (which could be eaten to provide useful intrinsics or sacrificed for a variety of gains) and death drops, leading to the infamous practice of pudding farming. However, Nethack 3.6.0 eliminated the ability of puddings to drop corpses, making this practice ineffective and pointless.\nIn SLASH'EM and Slash'EM Extended, black puddings never leave death drops, but they still drop normal corpses which can provide poison resistance (22%), cold resistance (22%) and shock resistance (22%). Pudding farming is still viable for sacrifice fodder and the aforementioned intrinsics.\n",

If they wait too long, the blood will \"coagulate\", becoming useless as a nutrition source. While blood consumed in this manner provides a very small nutritional value, the drained corpses are still eligible for sacrifice, reducing the need to weigh staying full against sacrificing.

    "giant": "Giants are a category of monsters in \"NetHack\". The giant, , is also a monster which normally only serves as the base for the corpse left by killing a giant zombie or giant mummy; its stats are identical to those of the stone giant.\nGiant corpses, including those of unique giants, have a 50% chance to increase your strength, similar to a non-cursed tin of spinach, when eaten in addition to any other intrinsics.\nDespite sharing some of the above traits, such as their size and their corpses giving strength bonuses, ettin and titans lack the codice_1 flag and are not considered giants.\nGiants that are not undead can occasionally be generated in groups. They have a 50% chance of being created with a boulder, and are often generated with a small assortment of gems. They may also be generated in throne rooms, becoming eligible as early as dungeon level 13. The 'base' giant is not randomly generated, but can be created by zapping a wand of undead turning at a giant corpse that is not left by a mummy or zombie.\nGiant corpses and their strength bonuses are frequently sought after, especially by physically weaker roles and races; most non-elven characters will seek out giant corpses to continue increasing their strength once it has hit 18. However, giant corpses are also very high in nutrition, and their high nutrition presents a choking hazard. A tinning kit such as the one Archeologists start the game with is recommended, and additionally makes the corpses of giant zombies and mummies safe as well; unlike spinach, tins of giant meat provide a strength increase even if cursed. \nCavemen and Valkyries in particular benefit from having hill giants and fire giants as their respective second quest monsters, and giant humanoids act as their second quest classes; this enables corpse farming, especially with the co-aligned sanctuary available to Cavemen, but also carries the danger that a randomly generated H may turn out to be a titan.\nWhile Archeologists and Priests can also access giant corpses as well as ettin corpses on their quest, their best source is the mummies and zombies, which are the respective second quest classes for them and only have a 3% chance of generation. Archaeologists have the advantage of starting with a tinning kit, and can makes these corpses safer to eat while not being satiated quickly; Priests will much prefer the gains from farming wraiths instead.\nIn SLASH'EM, there is only a 25% chance that strength gain will occur when eating giant meat. This does not affect the chance of gaining any other intrinsics from the corpse. It is now possible to encounter normally-generated \"plain\" giants as well.\nThe gigant is a playable race added in SLASH'EM Extended that is considered a sub-species of giant and shares some common traits, along with its corresponding player monster. They start the game with a boulder alongside the usual starting inventory for their role, and can pick up and throw more; however, they also start with incurable hunger. Giants generated outside of special levels and the quest branch will be peaceful towards gigants; gigants eating giant corpses is not considered cannibalism, however, and the intrinsic hunger may allow them to get more out of the meal on average.\n",

    "olog-hai": "Trolls are a class of monsters in \"NetHack\". They are notable because the corpses of dead trolls will revive (similar to the Riders). For that reason, trolls are one of the more annoying monsters. Trolls can also make use of polearms\u2014they can pound with one at the same range as a character who is Skilled in polearms. They have a 50% chance of being generated with either a ranseur, partisan, glaive, or spetum.\nGenerally speaking, for well armed characters, trolls do not pose a major threat, but preventing them from reviving can be tricky. There are a large number of ways to kill a troll permanently, many of which involve putting the corpse inside something:\nBULLET::::- Eat the corpse. It will disappear only when you are finished. During the meal, it may revive, or you may be interrupted, or you may become unconscious from rotten food. This is a readily available option as long as you are not satiated.\nBULLET::::- Let a pet eat the corpse. It will disappear as soon as the pet starts to eat, though this option is only available if you have a carnivorous pet.\nBULLET::::- Tin the corpse. This is the easiest option for those with a tinning kit.\nBULLET::::- Lock the corpse in a container. Useful for trolls generated in throne rooms, though they may revive while being carried to their destination. Nesting a container more than 2 levels deep will also prevent reviving, as will a bag of holding 97.5% of the time. You will receive the message \"You feel less hassled\" when a troll corpse stored in a container fails to revive.\nBULLET::::- Place the corpse in an ice box. The revival countdown will be paused. You can take it out later when you're ready to deal with it.\nBULLET::::- Stone the living troll with a cockatrice corpse. If there is a live cockatrice nearby, conflict can also (sometimes) induce the cockatrice to stone the troll.\nBULLET::::- Polymorph the corpse.\nBULLET::::- Throw the corpse into lava or water (if it isn't a water troll), and it will drown as soon as it revives.\nBULLET::::- Sacrifice the corpse.\nBULLET::::- Find or dig a pit, place the corpse in, and push in a boulder to bury it. Water can also be used in the place of a pit (90% chance if the troll in question is a water troll).\nBULLET::::- Lure the troll to the Rogue level, where monsters don't leave corpses, and kill it there.\nBULLET::::- Put the corpse in a cursed bag of holding and repeatedly #loot the bag until it disappears.\nBULLET::::- Destroy the container with the corpse in it: a magical explosion for bags of holding, or polymorph for any container.

When wearing a Mummy wrapping you are not invisible and therefore are not eligible to receive the see invisible intrinsic or the permanent invisibility intrinsic. Killing and eating two stalkers in rapid succession is one of the most reliable ways of obtaining these intrinsics. It should be noted that eating stalker meat in the heat of battle is not generally recommended as it will stun you upon consumption. \n",

The shrieker corpse also gives a 20% chance of poison resistance, and is safe to eat (unless they are rotten); further, as the shrieker is considered a fungus, consuming a shrieker corpse does not break the vegan or vegetarian conducts.\n",

Make sure to convert it (with an ordinary sacrifice) \"before\" sacrificing any orcs, as you will lose Luck if the altar is unaligned; still, losing Luck may be preferable to letting the corpse rot and wasting a chance to get one more foocubus.\n",

Polymorphing into a form that can hide under items produces the same message. If you are unable to speak from paralysis, unconsciousness, being in the middle of engraving, or else being in a form that prevents speaking, they will also leave. The guard will not notice you if you are invisible when they enter, and will leave when you move away from them.\nOtherwise, upon giving them a name, they will ask you to drop all of your gold and follow them out of the vault; this includes any gold you have in open inventory \"and\" in containers within your inventory, so stashing cannot fool them. Once they see you have no gold, they will open a passage from the vault to a nearby corridor in the dungeon and wait for you to follow them out; both the guard and passage will vanish once you safely reach the corridor. Items left inside the passage will be embedded in the solid rock; any monsters caught in the disappearing passage will be moved to a random location on the current level. If you attack the guard, attempt to escape by some other means, or take too long to comply, they will become hostile.
